3,pw8zc4,blahblahbystander,bb,52,Not wanting in laws staying with me during birth Husband is upset I dont want my in laws staying with us when I give birth Husband is upsetI am due next week and being induced if labor doesnt happen naturally before then medical reasons I cant go beyond due date My in laws are overbearing but they always mean well Prime example they came into town and helped us paint our new house about a month ago so sweet But my mother in law decided to wash all the babies clothes which Im thankful for however she decided she hated my washer and dryer and complained about it for weeks after and even made up a scenario where my dryer caught on fire and what if I couldnt get to my baby in time There is NOTHING wrong with my dryer she just didnt like it Then she found a wasp on the floor that my cat brought in and was playing with and demanded before they leave my father in law check all the windows for holes we have glass windows and our house is new because a wasp infestation would be terrible and even one bite would harm our baby just WILD scenarios that give me anxiety I already take medicine for anxiety and her scenarios put me on edge even more I already question myself as a mother I dont need someone else putting wild thoughts in my head She also loves to give advice when not asked and in general makes me feel incompetent a lot But I dont think she does this on purpose Shes just overbearing That said my husband was doing yard work last weekend and got into some poison ivy he treated it and its gone now But my mother in law text me yesterday TELLING me not asking that they are coming into town next week to treat our yard for poison ivy and meet the baby My husband and I already decided we would quarantine a week before the due date to prevent either of us getting sick before the due date And that no one would be allowed to come visit for at least  weeks I will be learning to breastfeed dealing with hormones adjusting to life in general and its our only time as a family of  before the holidays and my husband goes back to work full time he works  hour days so this time is important to both of us I should also mention that my in laws dont live close so when they come into town they stay for several days So they want to come stay in our home for days right before during or after I give birth They also have  other grandchildren that they babysit daily and when I say theyre always sick Ive never met such sickly kids And anytime I see my in laws I get sick too Im also immune compromised Basically I have all the reasons to say no How do I deal with this My husband is now saying he wants his parents to meet the baby right away and that theyre only trying to help us by coming to help the poison ivy in the yard I feel like what we decided is being thrown out the window Like my in laws are rude by telling me theyre coming to stay with me the week Im giving birth without asking And like my health and my childs health isnt taken seriously

8,pwhfgi,crd1293,bb,34,Tell me the foods you gag down because its good for baby Everyone promised me the first trimester would be the worst and it was in a lot of ways mostly due to anxiety and uncertainty but the nausea was horrible I was also diagnosed with GD very early and have been on a GD diet most of this pregnancy One of the things my prebaby diet was lacking was calcium because of a lactose intolerance but  plain yoghurt is GD friendly and a decent amount of calcium so ever since week  I have been gagging down at least half a serving of plain Greek yoghurt every damn day Im  weeks now and I still have to disassociate a bit while trying to choke it downWhat have you been choking down in pregnancy

12,pvyct7,RileyHire,bb,120,A warning to newly pregnant moms with What was X like for you questions Ive noticed a trend in this sub that a lot of the most negative experiences tend to get upvoted to the top Usually you have to scroll through at least  or  comments to find a more neutral or positive response to the question For example What did your epidural feel like The top comments say They tried four times to administer it and it failed every single time so I had to give birth in excruciating pain How long did it take you to get pregnant  years and tens of thousands of dollars in IVF treatment Was pregnancy or after labor recovery harder physically Both were the worst thing Ive ever experienced and it took me over a year to go back to  normal This is not to say that these experiences arent true or valid All pregnancy stories deserve to be told and heard Pregnancy happens on a wide spectrum and your experience is going to be entirely unique But dont let these stories scare you Just because theyre the most upvoted doesnt mean theyre the most likely to happen to you

15,pwfitf,justjoshin___,bb,12,TMIPressure in my butt Im  I noticed about  minutes ago on and off some anal pressure Its very uncomfortable I havent lost my mucus plus and my water hasnt broken This pressure almost feels like I have to poop really bad or pass gas Has anyone else had this Like is it labor starting or baby just preparing to come soon I read some stuff about it possibly being anal contractions but Im not sure this is my first baby so Im a little lost Ive also never had period cramps so Im not sure what that feels like as well when it comes to comparing contractions to that
16,pw3thi,Forward_Material_378,bb,55,Food tip for hospital stay Going off the post of the amazing meal and cake one lady received in hospital and seeing commenters say the food was shit at their hospital I HATE hospital food and after my first day stay I vowed I wouldnt go hungryrely on my husband to bring me food the next time around Pack a jar of peanut butter a jar of jam and a loaf of bread Not exactly fancy eating but at am when youre starving and waiting for breakfast  hours away you have something to fill you up Hubby can bring fresh bread as needed and youre not stuck starving between mealsYes I got a lot of looks and comments from everyone who walked into my room but I was there  days the second time around and it was a life saver
17,pwegm6,Malsmalsthepals,bb,15,FTM wdhow do I deal with my overwhelming mother during childbirth and recovery Hi there Let me start by explaining that this is my first pregnancy I have a phobia called BII Phobia blood injury and injection phobia Whenever I see an injury or blood or feel pain my body has a vasovagal response meaning I uncontrollably pass out It doesnt matter if I stub my toe or watch a gory movie I throw up and pass out without warning I know its pathetic lol Youre probably like why does this matter I can explainObviously childbirth is very painful and bloody This part of my pregnancy journey will be very difficult for me Injections dont bother me much but the thought of an IV being placed in me is enough to make me want to throw up Its ridiculous I know My OB is aware of my phobia and she told me my labor may result in an emergency csection No hate towards csections though I just want my baby born safely regardless of the route she takes to enter this world Im just terrified of the invasive procedure due to my phobia My OBs biggest fear is that I will pass out while pushing I really want the epidural despite my fear of it I know I cannot handle the pain that comes with childbirth and until I receive it I will be needing every ounce of focus and strength I have in me to hold myself together I havent experienced the pain myself but from everything I have gathered from everyones experiences its going to be rough I need to be as calm as possible This is why I decided I solely wanted my partner in the delivery room with me I have severe anxiety and issues with becoming overstimulated The less people the better This is where my mother comes into the pictureShe was very unhappy when I told her I did not want her present in the delivery room She is very good at overwhelming me and stressing me out For example she assumed she was going to be in the room and told me Im gonna be in between your legs while youre pushing recording This unnerved me to my very core I am an incredibly private person and this comment filled me with an ungodly amount of anxiety To be honest I feel like she would be over talking me the entire time and trying to force decisions onto me Luckily for me the hospital Im birthing at made a rule stating patients in labor and delivery can only have  support person This was enough to get her to stop bringing the topic up to me thank the Lord She accepted that but told me she would drive to the hospital and wait outside for my entire delivery until she can visit I felt this was unnecessary She told me I better be on my phone updating her every  minutes anytime I dilated or anytime there was a change or progression in my labor I told her I probably would not be on my phone as I would be focused on keeping myself calm I do not want her outside in the parking lot blowing me up every  minutes The thought of this is so suffocating it makes me feel like I cannot breathe and it hasnt even happened yet She got angry at me when expressed that I need to focus on me and my baby Not her She always says well Im the grandma I deserve to be included This weird entitlement is driving me nuts She said if I cant update her then my partner needs to as he wont be laboring He is my support person he is not there to update my mother on my private medical needs and information She is attacking my privacy and she doesnt understand her need for knowledge will stress me out and disrupt my progress Now childbirth isnt the only issue here She also told me word for word once OUR baby is here you wont be able to keep me away from your houseOnce I am home I dont want visitors immediately I want a few days to settle in with my baby and my partner I wont be taking recovery well as Ill be dealing with stitches of some sort and all of the bleeding both huge triggers for my phobia Plus Ill be learning how to breastfeed and mother my baby girl I just want time with my little family before I invite anyone over and when I told my mom this she said I was being selfishShe told me shes gonna buy a play pen for her house a high chair a bouncer and a bassinet She assumed the baby would be staying the night with her a bunch I told her this wasnt gonna happen and she said well okay Ill just sleep on your couch I dont want her to I just want her to respect my damn boundaries and call me before she comes to my house I gave her very basic rules as far as meeting my baby goes I told her she needs to refrain from posting about me when I go into labor she needs to ask permission before posting photos and she is not to post my childs full name and birthdate My brothers wife is pregnant right now too and my mother took it upon herself to announce their pregnancy to Facebook She posted about my pregnancy before I had the chance to as well And my IUGR diagnosis She told me she gets it but not without scoffing and telling me she thinks me and my brother are ridiculous for our rules She really doesnt think shes in the wrong for announcing our pregnancies before us or my private medical details Is this all really too much to ask for Am I being selfish Does ANYONE have any advice for how to handle an entitled mother
18,pweehg,flinchinfinch,bb,18,How do you plan to handle a reactive dog and a baby So I have a little dachshund mix I got four years ago when he was about  The shelter told me he was dog and kid friendly but they were sadly mistaken It was definitely disappointing but I love him for who he is and would never think of giving him up He has come such a long way since I found himThat being said I told myself Id never have kids around him If kids ask to pet him on walks I tell them no hes not nice When my nephew comes over their interactions are extremely controlled Im essentially holding him and petting his head while my nephew gently strokes his butt area He was doing well coexisting with my nephew on the ground but he got too loud with a toy and my dog lunged at him because he felt threatened so I had to put him behind the gate in the kitchen The thing is he couldve bitten but doesnt he just wants to warn you But I dont want to ever risk my babys safety I got bit on the face by my grandmas dog when I was four and luckily it didnt disfigure or traumatize me to the point of fearing dogs but it could have I dont want to lock him away especially when hes on the older side his health is poor and he probably will only live another couple years and hes extremely anxious Hes so accustomed to being quite literally up my partner and Is butts all day everyday I know he cant be and wont be my main priority when baby is here in a couple weeks but Ive been really anxious this whole pregnancy about the dynamic I firmly believe he is part of our family and deserves autonomy and love and freedomObviously when baby is small and contained theres way less of a threat but the second shes mobile Im terrified of something happening Hes already noticeably more agitated and unlike the dogs I see on the internet he is like appalled by my stomach as if he knows somethings growing in there to replace him He used to lay on me but wont go near my belly nowIf you have a reactive or aggressive dog how do you plan toalready handle everything My partner will be working  twelve hour shifts a week so its not like so we can divide attention I dont want my little buddy to regress and be miserable in his golden years because he was my first dog and a big part of my life But Im realistic that baby trumps dog and safety and vigilance are crucial here

20,pwj949,Rabberdabber3,bb,0,Mother  I just have to bitch today My mother is one of those oh just wait people  I cant make any kind of comment about not feeling  great without her saying something about how much worse it gets or just wait til this or that Shes making me insaneNot only that shes insanely overbearing She always wants to help which actually means tell you everything youre doing wrong andor do it her way instead I want you to feel ready and organized No one is ever fully ready mother Jesus And she knows damn well her type A personality OCD version of organized is NOT how I do things Any time she comes over she has to make some comment about clutter or some other bull Thats me mom Gtf over it alreadyI have avoided her so much my entire pregnancy  Now Im days maybe a week away from this kid being born and just the thought of her showing up here when Im tired and recovering and getting settled in is stressing me tf out The hospital isnt allowing visitors thank god but thats only going to save me for a couple days End rantfor now
21,pwjuck,crybaby5,bb,2,Anyone else feel weird about being called mom eventually w so the day of reckoning is close at hand Im excited to be back to normal physically  but feeling really depressed about everything else Part of that is the feeling like Ill never return to myself identitywise As fucked up as it sounds I dont want to be mommy Is it callous to teach my kid to just refer to me by my first name eventually when theyre old enough Even a nickname of some kind thats special to them would be fine I just have such an extreme negative association with this mother persona that I cringe at the thought of being referred to that way Im no contact with my own mom after a pretty traumatic falling out which certainly adds fuel to this mental fire

23,pwdsuh,faerieles,bb,6,Im scared to be honest with my obgyn I need advice Hi everyone I had my first OB appointment around almost two weeks ago and she asked if I was okay mentally I panicked and just mentioned I have occasional anxiety That is true but what I didnt mention was that I can get really depressed and me anxiety interferes with a lot of day to day activities Ive never gotten treated for any of this and there was once a time where I at my lowest and attempted suicide by overdose What that attempt caused was a trip to the ER with acute kidney failure the doctors asked how this happened and I brushed it off as I miscalculated what I took which Im sure was obvious to them that that was not the case Im no longer suicidal but I still deal with phases of depression especially really bad anxiety I am in CA am   weeks pregnant and I just want the best for my first baby I wasnt honest with my doctor because I was scared to be She knows about my kidney problems but Im scared that when she finds out the reason as to why that started I will be sent to the ward How can I tell her what will the outcome of telling her be

31,pwjy54,sadcthulu,bb,2,wks and really struggling  not sure where else to turn I have been stuck in early labor with contractions since wks As they progressed I became unable to sleep more than hrs a night This has persisted and got to the point two weeks ago where I became incoherent and fell I go to a birth center where they have midwives on rotation the midwife I saw shortly after just before wks told me that she wanted to put me on Ambien and do a membrane sweep at wks because she was concerned I would continue to degrade and go into labor with no real strength at allMy psychiatrist wanted me on Ativan instead which got me up to hrs of consistent sleep each night and I felt amazing for a week At my next appointment another midwife told me that she absolutely disagreed that I should get a sweep and that my body knows what its doing She wouldnt even do a cervical exam and also told me that if I went past wks they would just have me induced in the hospital anyway which feels quite hypocritical Were avoiding doing a membrane sweep to avoid intervening at the risk of needing a medical intervention Im bipolar and did express to her that I have been emotionally spiraling due to lack of sleep but this was not a concern to her My psychiatrist psychologist and myself are really concerned about this I had a breakdown over the weekend worse than Ive had in years My psychiatrist is concerned about switching through medications more because its such a short timeline and of course there will be a huge shift in hormones immediately after Im scared of PPD and I feel like Im being set up for failure every day just gets harder and as of this weekend Im back down to hrs of sleep a night I hallucinate sounds and struggle to function and I have to work on top of it I am not sure what else to do I have tried absolutely everything I can to help promote labor at home I am going to tell the midwives that Im getting worse but Im scared that if I tell them how far Ive degraded that theyll refuse to continue to work with me Is there another avenue I could pursue Could I show up at a hospital and beg for an induction Is there something I should be saying that Im not
32,pvpc7x,bearlyhereorthere,bb,276,Friend announced her pregnancy at a picnic I had planned in order to announce mine Should I be as upset as I am There are  of us girls in a group Since we are in lockdown and have been for months we are finally allowed to meet with fully vaxxed people for a picnic I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell my group of friends the good news so I organised a time and date My friend H knew that I was pregnant quite a few weeks ago She was pregnant at the same time I told her but didnt say anything at the time because she didnt want to steal my thunder  She told me yesterday she was pregnant weeks after I told her btw because she knew we were having this picnic today and knew I wanted to announce it She thought it would be better to hear from her before which I totally appreciated Our due dates are  week a partLiterally like  minutes into the picnic H tells everyone shes pregnant and having a baby girl and everyone gets so excited There is a lot of chat afterwards and I am just sitting there with my jaw dropped She didnt even leave me the decency to have some kind of segway into it or anythingConsidering what she said about stealing thunder previously I wasnt really sure how to bring it up again So I just didnt say anything  The rest of the picnic was all about her pregnancy and her symptoms and what names she wants and everything I really tried to be a good friend I really did but I dont think I hid my discontent very well I could barely look her in the eyes The whole thing was awkward as fuck for me but I dont know if anyone was receptive enough to realise thatI stayed at the picnic for another  mins or so and said I had to have attend a meeting a meeting with my midwife on the phone for a meet amp greet which had been rescheduled to later that week but they didnt know that I couldnt get out of there fast enoughI got home and cried and cried to my mom on the phone I am separated from my family all in Canada fuck you covid  and have heard recently that a close young family member has terminal cancer so I havent told some of my extended family because the news is so terrible and fresh I was really looking forward to today to take my mind off things Instead I am reminded that I am really alone in all this and cant share happy news with people I care about This was one of my only times to tell people in person not on a fucking Zoom chat and instead I just sat there as a bystander to someone elses good news and watch them receive the congratulations and all the good feelings you get from sharing good news with peoplePart of me understands she has also been socially isolated in this and has also had to announce her pregnancy to some of her family amp friends on Zoom so this was also her first time to share the happy news I just would have appreciated the decency of letting me announce or even giving me an opportunity afterwards like perhaps asked DO YOU HAVE ANY EXCITING NEWS Instead it was cricketsIts been a few hours and I havent even received a message or anything I probably need new friends TLDR Friend announced her pregnancy at a picnic I planned to announce mine before I had a chance Mix in some Covid shitness and isolation totally depressing Now I feel awkward and sad

38,pw2qz7,LymanForAmerica,bb,4,Graduated at  Very positive surprisingly easy medicated birth after weeks of leaking fluid with postpartum hurricane Before LaborSo we started trying to conceive in February  great timing right  We had two miscarriages May  and October  then conceived a third time in December   Due date was August I am not at all an anxious person but I definitely didnt let myself get excited early on due to our previous experiences  We had an episode of bleeding at  weeks and I was sure it was over but everything was fine And after that everything progressed totally normally  good ultrasounds good NIPT passed GD screening etc  Overall I had a very boring and standard pregnancyI was  cm dilated at my  and  week appointmentsOn August  at  I woke up and got out of bed and felt a gush of fluid  It soaked through my underwear not through my clothes but it was completely different than any discharge Id had  I was sure my water had broken  I called my OBs office when they opened and the OB was out sick but a nurse told me to go to LampD within  hours  So I went to work that day wrapped up as much as I could and my husband and I headed to the hospital around pmThey took me to triage husband had to wait in the parking lot until I was admitted due to COVID  I was having regular contractions and was  cm  They did a fluid test which came back negative but it had been  hours since Id had the gush of fluid  They said it was probably just discharge and sent me homeI kept having gushes of fluid every morning when I woke up until I went into labor  I really think that I had a high leak because Im certain it wasnt discharge  It probably pooled while I was lying down at night and was only enough to be noticeable when I stood in the morning I even tested it at one point with my husbands ph strips for the pool LOL and it came back high which indicates amniotic fluidBUT literally no one believed me  They all kept telling me that I was peeing myself even though the fluid was  colorless my prenatal made my urine bright yellow and  a totally different smell  My doctor was out sick this whole time so I saw NPs my next two weekly visits and they basically just shrugged and said to go to LampD if I thought I was leaking which was NOT helpful since I already did thatOn August  I had another big gush of fluid the biggest one yet  It soaked through my underwear and pants  I went to LampD immediately this time hoping that the fluid test would come back positive without waiting  BUT the nurse checked my dilation first  cm now and the check made me bleed and she said that the test to see if its amniotic fluid is invalid if there is blood  Not sure why she didnt do the swab first then but whatever  She agreed that it felt slippery like amniotic fluid and not discharge but without the test confirming it they sent me back homeI finally got to see my doctor at my  week visit a few days later and she agreed that I probably had a high leak  Finally  I felt like everyone else thought that I was exaggerating but she knew that I had been pretty low key the whole pregnancy so maybe thats why she believed me  Anyway she told me not to worry unless the leak was enough to soak a pad or I started running a fever which seems reasonable  I wish someone else had told me that earlier since everyone makes it sound like any leaking fluid is an emergency  At that visit I was still  cm  My OB also said that she didnt think I would make it to my induction a week laterLaborOn August  I started having mild contractions  They felt like period cramps but with a noticeable onset peak and decrease and were timeable every  minutes At that point they were weak enough that I was able to stay at work and work through them without problem  They decreased in frequency around pm so I figured it was a false alarmI woke up exactly at midnight on August  with real contractions  Id been having Braxton Hicks for months and people always said that you know when theyre real and it didnt make sense to me until then  But it was TOTALLY DIFFERENT  They were painful and lower than the Braxton Hicks and strong enough that I definitely couldnt go back to sleepI walked around the house and by am I had to breathe through them  By am I couldnt sit anymore when I had one and they were  minutes apart  I called LampD and the nurse recommended drinking a liter of water taking a shower and coming in if the contractions didnt change  I did both of those walked around a little more then finally woke my husband up at am and told him that it was go timeWe went to LampD I went back to triage familiar with it at this point and they hooked me up to the monitor  Surprise my  contractions didnt show up  In fact my contractions wouldnt show up on the monitor until I was given pitocin with my epidural at cm even though I dilated from cm to cm on my own between midnight and am  So the monitors can lie  Dont let them tell you that youre not having contractions just because the monitor doesnt pick it upThe nurse checked and I was cm dilated when I had been cm at my appointment a day or two before  She told me to walk around while she contacted my doctor so I walked around triage from am  She checked again at am and my dilation hadnt changed but the doctor told her to admit me since Id changed so much since my appointment  Basically no one but my OB ever believed me about anything but I am so glad that she didThey admitted me and my husband was able to come upstairs  At this point it was am and I was still contracting but they had slowed down  The doctor came in at am I was cm then and she broke my water  The contractions definitely ramped up so thats when I asked for the epidural  I didnt really have a birth plan and hadnt decided about medicatedunmedicated before that day  But since Id already been awake all night I decided that I definitely wanted the epidural to try to get some sleep  At this point I still thought that this would probably take a whileI got the epidural around am and it worked perfectly  No pain at all  The nurse checked me immediately after it went in and I was cm then  From that point I progressed from cm to cm in an hour and the nurse started the peanut ball which is this weird pillow thing that you put between your legs to encourage the baby to drop  They would switch me from side to side occasionallyBy am I was cm and  effaced  My doctor was delivering another baby so they asked if I could just wait and I was totally happy to do so  I just chilled no pain me and my peanut ball  Around am I started to feel some crampy pain on the right side as the epidural wore off  It was bearable but annoying  My doctor was now in an emergency csection so I just kept waiting but I was starting to feel pressure too  Looking back Im really glad that I was able to wait on the pushing and let the baby come down on her own since I hated the pushing phase  In the future I think I might try to wait a little longer to push as little as possibleAround pm the nurse said the doctor would be ready soon so we started practice pushes  My doctor came in after a few and said that the baby was posterior so she reached in and just turned the baby around  It wasnt painful with the epidural and after reading so many birth stories with sunny side up babies I am very glad that she was able to do thatAt this point the epidural had worn off enough that I could feel the contractions and push with them which was perfectThe doctor told us to keep pushing she was going to go to the computer outside to finish her notes from her other births that morning  Ok great  Well three contractions later and babys head was RIGHT THERE  The nurse goes outside to get the doctor and she had gone downstairs to lunch LOL again  Apparently she figured since this was my first we were going to be waiting a little while  They had to page the doctor and she rushed upstairs  Three contractions later baby was born  I felt a lot of pressure but no real pain or ring of fire I guess because the epidural still had enough juice in it  Really the contraction when she was born didnt feel much different than the contractions in the last  minutes of pushingIn total I pushed for about  minutes They put her right on my chest and my first words were holy shit its a real baby  Its been a month now and I still think the same thing sometimes when I look at herI ended up with a second degree tear  two sutures going backwards and one going forwards  I didnt even notice the placenta being delivered  The baby was born at pm  hours after my first contraction  Really I dont think that it could have gone any better  I expected it to be a slow and difficult labor since my mom and sisters all had hard labors and all ended up with csections so I was pretty shocked at just how easy the whole thing was  I was a big fan of the epidural and I think mine was timed perfectly to remove pain during active labor but still allow me to feel the contractions enough to push with themPostpartumI had a very positive postpartum experience too even though we got hit with Hurricane Ida at  days ppThe one thing I wish I had known about was the hemorrhoids from pushing I have never had hemorrhoids before had none during pregnancy and the hemorrhoids I got from pushing were hands down the worst part of my recovery The second degree tears were nothing in comparisonMy doctor gave me hydrocortisone cream but they only started getting better with Preparation H too I thought they would never go away but they shrunk down almost overnight about  weeks postpartum My second degree tears were sensitive for a few days but never painful I never needed any of the pain medication that my doctor sent home My stitches came out themselves around  weeks ppI am a business owner and so theres no such thing as maternity leave I was back at work for a couple of hours to triage and delegate at  days pp which was doable but not great I planned on going in twice a week for a few hours at a time but then at  days pp we got hit by IdaWe stayed for the storm We werent in the cone but we werent far We got winds up to about  mph lost power and had a bunch of trees come down It was almost good that it happened so early since Baby was still in the sleepy newborn phase and just slept and ate the whole time I am very grateful to have not needed a Csection or have had a difficult recovery because I was out doing major yard cleanup including cutting fallen trees with a chainsaw at  days pp When we realized that power would be a while we went to stay with family a few hours away and the drive wasnt a problem Overall I feel very very lucky to have had an easy recovery There are a lot of posts about difficult recoveries so I expected it to be painful for weeks and I was pleasantly surprised I dont think its anything that I did I think its just luck Baby tax httpsimgurcomaLyFxBvT

50,pwdo02,Defiant_Soup7990,bb,16,Any other team greens who feel like their Drssonographers slipped babys gender Or DID slip gender Since before pregnancy my fiance and I decided that we did not want to know the gender of our baby until they are born I love the surprise but it is especially important to my fiance and always has been Morally and spiritually it means a great deal to him to find out the day they are born I was very adamant about making sure every doctor I spoke to knew we do not want to know the gender Especially once it came to ultrasounds It was the first thing out of my mouth with every person I spoke to even the receptionist because I was so worried about the surprise being spoiled There have been two things that made me feel like my sonographer and my doctor screwed up but maybe some of you can reassure me or let me know if these things are normal or sound like slips The first thing was pretty dismissable which was simply that the sonographer told us to look away when she looked at the lower half of our baby and then said very casually  now lets see if I can get his little face to turn My heart skipped a beat from the slip my stomach dropped for my fiance I looked over at him to make sure he wasnt already super disappointed in finding outbut he didnt really look phased or like he caught it so I never brought it up It didnt help that a few sentences and subjects later the sonographer had to remind us that even they cant always tell The second thing that happened that felt extremely telling to me is that my OB asked about paying for  circumcision if we were opting for one because my insurance wouldnt totally cover it or something and Id need to pay ahead blah blahShe has reassured me constantly that once you put on your file you do not want to know the gender nobody knows I cant see how that is possibly true because medically speaking I feel like they need to knowhave it noted For once I felt glad that my fiance could not come to one of my appointments because of covid rules I looked at her square on and asked how would I address this in advance if I do not know what gender I am having yet I then reminded her that our choice about this subject is already in the paperwork we filled out months ago so I didnt get even bringing it up no judgement on those that do but were opting NOT toso the questionsubject coming up felt even more tellingShe seemed a little awkward and said that is a good question and apologized for forgetting our choice This unfortunately later did have to come up with my fiance with my own twist on how it came up because I got worried about a circumcision happening when we have already put no if its a boy If I am having a boy that is just as exciting to me as having a girl But Im not going to lie I feel like I had the surprise pulled from me months ago and Ive sort of just been keeping it to myself because I didnt feel it fair to spoil it for my partnerAm I reading too far into these situations Are sonographers and doctors just really awkward about basic routine things and these are common questions and use of words

and proofread it lolSo Im writing this a bit late shes now  months old But I know that reading positive birth stories really helped me throughout my pregnancy because I was so scared of labour so here goesI wanted a natural water birth maybe a bit of hypno birthing definitely not on my back I wanted to do whatever I could to minimise my pain and minimise tearing coz I was terrifiedWell none of that happened but it was a great birthStarted having very mild contractions throughout Sunday In the evening when I was laying down to watch a film they felt quite regular every  mins but once the film was over and I stood up I didnt have another one for half an hour and because they were so mild I figured it was just braxton hicks maybe or my body practicingWell during the night around am I kept waking up because of the contractions It wasnt enough to hurt but it was obviously enough to keep waking me up Eventually around am I woke up properly and decided to have a bath and count the contractions Well they were  minute in length  minutes apart and that went on for an hour so I got out of the bath and phoned the hospital She said to try and labour at home for as long as I could so I said no problem  they still werent really hurting so I figured Id try and get some sleep as it looked like this might be the real deal I tried to sleep but kept waking the contractions were starting to hurt a little Deciding this was definitely the real deal I went downstairs and made a sandwich figuring I should eat as much as possible now as I was going to have a long labour ahead of me I tried to eat it but after the first half I felt kinda sick It was around pm by now and I decided to have another bath as I didnt really know what to do with myself and I wanted a water birth rightSo I was in the bath for about another hour trying to relax listening to music and true crime but the contractions were definitely starting to get stronger I started sitting up with each one nowSo pm I get out of the bath and call down to my partner that I think its probably time Im going to get the bags ready call my mum who was my birth partner and then maybe we should start heading to the hospitalpm everything hits the fan lol My partner is in the bathroom going for a wee and Im in the bedroom pottering around getting bits ready I start to feel queasy and hold onto the bed for support All of a sudden I projectile vomit across the bed and feel something leak out between my legsMy partner comes out and starts helping me change my clothes all the while Im apologising and then another contraction makes me grab the edge of the bed and bend over A few minutes later we are in the car and Im ringing the hospital the woman doesnt seem to understand what Im trying to tell her and I keep getting contractions that make me grab the roof handle and grunt  minutes later we are at the hospital my partner drops me off to go pick my mum up from work I walk into the reception and go to the toilet Theres blood everywhere and I start panicking I lost a baby before this one and all throughout the pregnancy I had been so scared I make my way to reception and wait in line Finally its my turn and I ask where the maternity ward is She asks me if I have an appointment and my poor muddled brain is just like nothe baby is coming now I dont have an appointmentThe next contraction hits and Im gripping the reception doubled over Someone appears to my right and supports me They guide me to a chair and ask if Id like a glass of water All I can mumble is that I think somethings wrong with the baby She brings me a glass of water and disappears Another contraction hits while Im sat down and Im twisting in my seat I felt like I wanted to get on my knees on the floor but the reception was full of people Suddenly there is  or  people around me with a wheelchair and someone is helping me into it They are asking if I have anyone with me and Im trying to explain that my mum is coming but shes not here yet and she has my bags They start wheeling me away down some corridors and all of a sudden my mum is at my side Im trying to explain to her that I think something is wrong and getting another contraction and gripping her handWe get into the room and I am helped onto the bed I twist so I am kneeling on it gripping the head of the bed as another one hits I start whimpering and saying this is too much can I have the epidural please it hurts so bad I cant do this for the next  hours and Ive done my research I know its only gonna get worse The nurse manages to convince me to lie down so she can examine me She confirms that the blood was just the mucus plug and that nothing is wrong with the baby I start grinning because Im so relieved and then another contraction hits and Im asking for the epidural again She examines my cervix and confirms I am  and cm dilated I start laughing saying thank fuck for that its fine I dont need the epidural I thought I would be like cm I look at the clock and its about pm They ask me if I want gas and air and I say no but eventually agree The next bit is a blur gas and air is very helpful lol I remember using the gas and air and making noises I remember insisting I didnt want to be on my back but they kept telling me I had to be I remember them asking me if they could put a needle under her scalp and I remember them saying she was stuck on the ubend Eventually they took the gas and air off me and the brain fog lifted They kept pressing a heart monitor into my public area which hurt but within a few pushes her head was out It didnt hurt nearly as much as I thought it would They told me to reach down and feel her head sticking out It was very hairy and wet and soft One more push and she was out my mum put her on my chest and when I looked down at her she was exactly how I had picturedI just stayed there while everyone pottered around staring at this tiny baby with a head full of hair her eyes open fingers in her mouth just snuggled into my chest and looking around with unseeing eyes My mum cut the cord they weighed her and gave her a vitamin k shot and brought her back I breastfed her and she pooped all over my stomach and chest her little legs smearing it up my arms and all I could do was laugh it wasnt gross in that moment I was just on cloud  She was born at pm We stayed in the hospital until pm the next day Those were the best  hours of my life this tiny bundle swaddled up in her little cot I could pick her up and cuddle her and feed her and dress her and just stare at her for hours She didnt cry until she was a week old so those first  hours were just a quiet tranquil euphoria The reason they had been monitoring her heart was because when she got stuck in the u bend her cord was wrapped around her body so everytime I pushed the blood flow was getting reduced and her heart rate was dropping Apparently after she came out a swimming pool of water followed her and I ruined three nurses shoes I was so terrified of giving birth and the pain but my body knew exactly what to do And now shes just gone  months and is the most precious thing in the world to me Unfortunately her father turned abusive after she was born so when she was  months old we fled to a homeless shelter and weve been here for three months Hopefully we will be able to find a house soon and we can begin the next chapter of our lives together I wish I could go back and relive that day despite the pain as it was just magical

225,puocox,wasting_ti,bb,18,Horrible anxiety about first appointment I am due for my first appointment on Tuesday I dont know how I made it so far tbh but its kicked up a notch I dont really have any pregnancy symptoms just some mild food aversion and fatigue When I first found out I was pregnant I was spotting and cramping I did an US at  and everything was ok with a heartbeat That was a month ago and since then I have discovered about MMC and have seen several people saying that no symptoms could mean unhealthy pregnancy So now I am just freaking out and convinced I am not pregnant anymore I know I will find out on Tuesday and every time I bring it up to my friends or my husband I just get the usual Youre fine and Stop worrying so much I dont blame them but its killing me I think that having a first appointment with your OB or Midwife at  weeks is absurd Leaving women especially FTM completely uninformed and to the mercy of Google is awful I feel like I am sinking and days are just getting longer and longerI walked by a bunch of newborn clothes at a store and just stopped by to look at them and the first thing that popped into my head is Why am I looking at this Im not even pregnant I dont do well with waiting around and things just happening TO me that I cant control Ive basically robbed myself of any kind of joy about being pregnant so far because Im just waiting for something horrible to happen at any moment Ugh I dont really have a question just more of a rant I hope to come back here Tuesday with good news

269,pu760a,RareSinger2085,bb,12,Im getting tired of my mom I believe I made a post a few months ago about not wanting to tell my mother about my pregnancy because how awkward it was for me Long story short shes very religious and never got to have a close relationship with her due to that fact In moral religious terms my pregnancy came in a right timing married in a healthy relationship with my best friend It was just awkward for me because I never pictured myself pregnant and I feel its still something intimate for me to be sharing even if its my motherI told her about my pregnancy when I was about  months along currently  and she was really excited It actually felt good to talk about it with someone else than my husband but what happened right after my call She stopped replying my texts because she was too busy telling her siblings and friends I remember I cried a lot the next day because I suddenly felt ignoredNow like I mentioned I was never really close with her When I recently got married I would ask her to visit and call whenever she had time and she rarely did when I called her she sounded uninterested it just felt like she didnt care It was fine in the end it was better to feel ignored than to be yelled at for any silly reason like it was before I got marriedTo this day she tries to call me at least twice a week which is a lot for our relationship standards she invited herself during the winter holidays and I try to insist that we rather be alone getting used to being parents but she insists with you just dont understand how important is to become a grandmother SeriouslyShe refers to my baby as my boy and I asked many times to stop doing that since hes not hers and its uncomfortable She now suddenly cares about what I tell her my Drs appointments husbands job what Im eating Its overwhelming because I feel disrespectedIt was my MIL who I was preparing mentally to have this behavior we havent told her yet because shes even more difficult and now turns out my mother is also an entitled one I feel like one of these days Im going to explode and be more aggressive when I speak to her Im happy with having a close relationship with her but this doesnt feel like being the right way

317,ptnzeu,Helloworld123467,bb,45,Just a gentle warning for those planning to labor in a tub Hi all I just wanted to share my experience as a warning for those who want to labor in a tub obviously this isnt everyones experience but if I could hopefully prevent anyone else from dealing with this that would be awesome So I gave birth August th to a healthy baby boy My water broke early on in labor before cm dilated and bc I was GBS I had to go to the hospital right away I also just want to say that my hospital was amazing I felt like I had a great birth experience and it was a very clean and organized place With that said I spent  hours in the labor tub they have when things got too intense cm and it was amazing I was one with this bath tub I loved this bathtub Its the reason why I felt like I was able to give birth without an epidural My hospital doesnt allow tub deliveries so after I was close to  cm I popped out Labor went smoothly no epidural progression happened quickly and steadily and no tearing it was the labor I wantedFast forward ish weeks and I am dealing with  postpartum infections the first was a standard UTI that went unnoticed until it got to my kidneys the second is a strange bacterial infection called pseudomonas I am lucky enough to have my best friend be my primary care physician and my brother and sisterinlaw are ICU pharmacists When I told them what my friend said I had they were thrown off by it Pseudomonas are something they see all the time in the hospital its a very common hospital bacterial for hospitalized patients not something you see in a young healthy person They asked if I had had a catheter in during labor and I said no its common for patients who have a catheter put in and out often or other medical equipment put in its not something that you get by just being at a hospital They thought about it and the only thing they could think where I couldve gotten it from is the tub and their theory makes sense I feel so betrayed by the thing I loved Ive been dealing with fevers infections testing and imaging a night at the ER for that last  weeks likely bc of the tub My doctor out of an abundance of caution ordered a uterine ultrasound and they saw there was still tissue in there and she thinks I might need to have a DampC to have it removed given all the infection I have so far I am young and without tooting my own horn VERY healthy Ive never had to deal with anything like this Im not saying all tubs are bad Im saying maybe consider wiping the tub down yourself not using the jets they were just on for a minute to see if I liked them or reconsider the tub if your water is broken This has been so stressful Ive had to be away from my baby when I was in the ER I had to stop breastfeeding for a bit bc of conflicting medications I just want my experience to potentially keep someone from dealing with the same thing

329,pu2fkt,Ok_Upstairs,bb,12,A very first world problem that still feels overwhelming because of pregnancy emotions Okay would love to get some advice on this but if this isnt allowed mods feel free to remove Also obligatory on mobile so sorry for formattingtyposBasic scenario is that weve been offered two cribs and I only like one of them but I dont know how to deal with the social aspect of choosing the one we like The more in depth detail is that the first crib comes from a family member that will definitely at some point see the nurserypictures of it and know if we dont stick with what they gave us This family member is really kind but can also be pretty passive aggressive and weve had a strained relationship for like  years Pregnancy and preparing for baby has really brought us together and she gave us her old crib instead of donating it elsewhere Im really grateful for her generosity and I feel so relieved to know we have a safe place for baby to sleep when she gets here The problem is that I kind of hate the look of the crib Its old but not antique and just kind of huge and gaudy which definitely feels out of place in our small apartment Im ashamed to admit this because it shouldnt matter but a friend came over the other day and wanted to see the nursery and i was embarrassed by how out of place the crib felt I think I also just have a sensitivity about feeling out of style largely because while growing up the aforementioned family member made me feel selfish or stupid if I liked something trendy This still happens occasionally though much less frequently It would be fine to keep the first crib but my husbands coworker just offered us a free crib that feels like it fits us and our apartment muchbetter I know that baby wont care but Im wondering how much it matters that I care Is it selfish and stupid to want a more trendy nursery And if not how would I address it with my family member I dont think it would ruin our relationship but Im worried it could upset the good bonding weve had recently

362,pt3n52,iam1teddy,bb,49,Talk to your partner BEFORE the baby is here about your expectations regarding the distribution of tasks Discuss it in depth Talk about details Lately Ive seen a lot of posts on parenting subs were one partner complains that they have a very high workload with baby household work etc Quite often they are also complaining that their partner doesnt contribute enough and that they feel left alone Please please please discuss this before your baby is born And I mean REALLY discuss it The more details the better I think Dont just say I will take care of the baby you will go to work we will do chores together Make a list of tasks and include everything Changing nappies feeding putting baby down to sleep cooking cleaning finances gardening pets shopping for groceries and clothes doctors appointments etc  everything Please also dont forget the mental load eg planning what to cook which clothes are needed when appointments are research what does a baby eat besides milk and from when on how can parents help them develop eg which toys make sense How will all of this be divided when one partner stays at home Or when both go to work There are a lot of things to consider Maybe or hopefully you have already divided many tasks as a couple If your load is high already compared to your partner  good luck Make sure that you dont have to take care of two kids after baby is born ie baby and your partnerFrom my experience I can say that caring for a baby is a lot more work and takes way longer than I expected when I was pregnant There are also things you dont take into account before the baby is here maybe others can add what their experience was like or what surprised them For example for me it was the fact that a baby sleeps  hours a day plenty of time to do chores huh Nope They do sleep But sometimes it takes them long to fall asleep Maybe they only sleep on you Or as soon as you start cleaning they are wide awake again Why should you discuss this already while being pregnant Because at least the first few weeks of your babys life on earth you dont have the time or the nerves or the energy to discuss it Of course you have to keep talking with your partner its an ongoing discussion and communication is very important But its easier to talk when you have already layed the foundationThis has gotten quite long I hope it helps somebody If you have any tips feel free to add them in the comments

381,ptihcq,September1Sun,bb,2,Graduated th September slightly scary but all good in the end natural delivery I woke up at am on a standard work day definitely not in labour just getting pummelled by kicks and movements as per usual He then did a big movement and kicked my ribs really hard I heard a pop and i first thought hed cracked a rib but then I realised my waters had broken I had heard it can be like accidentally wetting yourself but mine was way more than that you couldnt pee that fast There was a lot I woke hubby up and got him to fetch a maternity pad and new underwear while I lay there trying not to leak anymore Contractions began as a period like cramp that lasted about a minute then disappeared for  mins Once I could get up I phoned the maternity triage number as directed previously only to get told the line was busy Got through to someone after  mins only for them to say they werent a midwife they were just manning the lines to help out Theyd get a midwife to call back  when they could but I could phone back if worried Contractions were now getting painful and more frequent In the gaps I left messages for people at work so they knew not to expect me at various meetings that day I phoned triage again at  as contractions were now one min on one min off and I thought we were supposed to go in at one every five mins The same lady as before answered but fetched a midwife to the phone Midwife said that my contractions were a reaction to the waters breaking but would slow down through early labour however as my waters had broken theyd have a look at me but were likely to send me home Hubby packed the last things in the bag while I got dressed between contractions and vomited a bit As we got through town there was traffic at a standstill We eventually saw a police escort of a large vehicle convoy after that passed the traffic started moving I vomited again trying to catch it in a face mask but getting it all down my top It took  mins to get to the hospital so about  by this point We park and get into triage where they are moving at a glacial speed They ask to see my pad to check for any amniotic fluid Ive drenched my second by now and these things are massive and offer me some paracetamol I accept even though this is ridiculous Im attached to two monitors because hes premature One is for his heart rate and one tracks contractions An assistant does a lateral flow and a PCR test on me The midwife returns sees the soaked pad doesnt bother to test it as its clearly my waters checks the monitors and sees regular contractions so goes to examine me It wasnt exactly comfortable but less painful than the contractions She announces Im cm dilated Finally this prompts some urgency and they say I have to go to delivery now and Im wheeled off in my bed at speed I am put in a small room and asked to move to the other bed I find myself rather paralysed by pain Hubby tries to help support me but he realises how impaired I am and just lifts me over Its lucky that I am small An identical pair of monitors are strapped on me and its clear Ill have to give birth lying on my back on the bed which wasnt a position I found particularly easy to work with My midwife is young with a calm authoritative and professional manner Her age will be relevant later She is assisted by a student midwife Other people appear in the room and afterwards Hubby told me there were eight members of staff most on standby in case they were needed Im given gas and air and told that I cant have any other pain relief I was going to have this baby before an anaesthetist could even get down to the room let alone place an epidural It was ridiculously painful Gas and air is hard to have if you are very used to yoga as it involves deep breaths in through the mouth and I was used to breathing in through my nose My body started pushing during a contraction at some point it was involuntary and my brain had no part in the matter Weird noises left my mouth with me having no say in the matter there either The midwife has me push with the contractions and we get into slowly moving his head down Hubby tells me afterwards that babys heart rate is in the s dipping to s during contractions which is totally fine The midwife then tells me the cord is around his neck and baby must come out NOW No more gas and air hold my breath chin to chest and push with all my might I do thus It is insanely painful I find out later that his heart rate had gone way down indicating that the cord was now compressed His head was now out and Hubby saw her slip the cord over his head so he was okay She has me push again to get his shoulders out and hes placed on my stomach looking pretty decent and I get to hold him with a towel over him The cord is short so he cant come up any higher The many people watching slip away silently My notes say his  min APGAR was  so he was born absolutely fine thanks to my brilliant midwife and her clear directions I opt for active management of the placenta through sheer impatience and get a painful injection for my troubles My notes say the placenta was out  mins later It was more pushing to get it out which I did not care for as I was thoroughly fed up with pushing The placenta is thoroughly inspected to make sure it is whole My midwife shows me it and explained which bit went where My midwife cleaned me up and assessed the damage I was very torn due to the urgency of the delivery She thinks it is just about what she is allowed to deal with but calls a surgical consult to be sure He confirms its not quite bad enough for me to be sewn up in the operating theatre and talks over the approach with her I have three deep tears through skin and muscle and one is very large and almost third degree I have more gas and air plus local anaesthetic while she sews She admits she really enjoys that bit and neat sewing is her speciality She also says she recognises me and we realise she is an ex student from class of  The hazards of being a teacherI had skin to skin with baby for about  mins by the time this is finished Then I generously hand him over to Hubby to hold while I get up and stretch I realise there is blood everywhere and the midwife confirms I had lost a lot I have to pee for them I cant remember why then I elect to take a shower as the room is ensuite I get blood everywhere Those wounds are deep Baby is then measured and is kg which is the th percentile for his gestational age much bigger than the kg predicted by the fundal height measurement chart Im fed a jacket potato and we get cups of tea Baby gets a vitamin k shot Midwife has me hand expressing colostrum which i was unaware my body would do It took ages to get ml ffs We are taken by wheelchair to our first ward  Ill do a postpartum post in a day or soEDIT this happened at  and took  hours from start to finish Had a laugh with hospital staff about how this is not a typical first time birth experienceEDIT  The kg at

444,pslc09,welcometotemptation,bb,27,Thoughts on gender disappointment  months post partum I was thinking about this topic because it was close to a year ago that we found out the gender of our now  month old baby I figured Id share some thoughts since some of you who are expecting may be struggling with this right nowFWIW we both wanted a girl but we didnt really realize it until we found out we were going to have a boy I remember feeling strangely deflated then feeling very guilty about it I had seen so many judgmental people talk about gender disappointment like its close to child abuse and I admit I had some of those judgmental feelings myself before I got pregnant I just didnt understand it but then suddenly I was in the middle of it So heres my journey to getting over it It sounds so cliche but feel your feelings Cry about it mope about it write about it The more you feel them the more you will realize that like most temporary feelings these too will pass through you Take your time with it You dont have to tell people the gender if you dont want to You can announce it whenif youre ready Think about gender stereotypes ideas expectations Most of us go through this journey of unpacking a lot of thoughts we thought we had left behind or didnt have until you are hit with gender disappointment Suddenly you find yourself thinking in these stark opposites girls are like this boys are like that Meanwhile in our daily lives in our own lives we know that gender isnt like that Girls can do boy hobbies have interests more typically associated with boys and boys do the same for girly hobbies Not to mention your child could end up going on their own journey and not identifying strongly with either gender  It takes time to adjust your perspective And thats fine I found myself looking at the world in a new way and slowly grew into the idea of what the future would hold It sounds so silly but something as strange as seeing a cute toddler of the same gender as your baby will be or buying some really adorable baby clothes that lean more toward one gender  A lot of early childhood is the same regardless of what gender your baby is Poop sleep milk feedings crying soothing napping Its a whirlwind regardless of whether you have a boy or a girl Some people will swear up and down boys sleep better or girls are easier to handle I call bs Babies have differing temperaments I dont think there are two categories by gender You will in all likelihood get over disappointment sooner than you think I still remember the moment I was resting my legs amidst Christmas shopping and saw a really cute dad and son duo in a nearby cafe I just thought about that same scene with my future son and my partner and I couldnt wait to get to that future Now Im so besotted with this baby as I knew I would be but it didnt mean that those feelings didnt hurt when they happened I hope this helps somebody out there Feel free to share your own journeys of gender disappointment and what helped and how you got past it

554,ps7rpg,cheetahgurlllll,bb,5,Switching doctors at  weeks Im currently    and feeling extremely unhappyanxious with my doctor A little back story I had been seeing a fantastic doctor where I moved from until ish weeks I moved a couple hours away so seeing her was no longer an option I then switched to a doctor who I wasnt super familiar with but I liked her and felt comfortable enough Anyways I ended up losing my insurance so I had to make another switch at  weeks because my doctor I had just switched to did not accept Medicaid My first appointment with him went fairly well but I was a little turned off by the office staff and their rudeness Last week my  week appointment my blood pressure was slightly high so the nurse said we would just retake it after the doctor sees me I waited about  minutes for him and while waiting I was hot and uncomfortable had to pee and was already a little nervous because of the slightly high blood pressure reading Finally doctor comes in and basically shoved his fingers inside of me to check my cervix feels my belly to see where baby is at and thats it He did not ask how I was doing and I honestly felt really rushed I got dressed and pretty much made a beeline for the restroom where I get flagged down to have my blood pressure retaken I told her that I really needed to use the restroom and cool down a bit and then I would be ready to have it retaken She seemed a little annoyed by this but whatever I have to pee lady So my blood pressure gets retaken and it was  Lovely She then tells my doctor and he pretty much tells me that its way too high and that I need to go to LampD for monitoring I pretty much broke down and had a panic attack right there I was terrified because this is my first baby and also because I felt completely alone Due to COVID I have to go to my appointments alone My doctor asked why I was so upset and was confused as to why I was freaking out He seemed annoyed that I was crying and scared and there was absolutely no comfort or reassurance from the nurse or him They just stared at me like I was an idiot My boyfriend took me to LampD and the nurses were so sweet and reassuring Sure enough my blood pressure went back to normal pretty much right away and all of the tests they ran came back normal Baby was also doing great I have another appointment with him this week and Im honestly dreading it I feel so anxious and uneasy with how I was treated and I really want to switch doctors I know its extremely late in the game but Im just so uncomfortable and dont have a good feeling about this guy I was thinking of calling around tomorrow morning to see if I can find anyone who is willing to see me this lateHas anyone else switched this late Any adviceinsight would be greatly appreciated Thank you

647,prxkd4,captaintor,bb,22,Only  weeks pregnant and already having mom guilt Im pregnant with my first yay and Im trying to decide with my husband how we want to approach feeding Of course my first instinct was breast feedingnatural freeish seems to be the best option However after talking it through more with my husband Im not sure its the best option for usWe both work pretty demanding jobs and after my mat leave it would be amazing to split night feedings  so we can both get decent sleep once and a while Plus my husband feels pretty strongly that he wants to be involved in the feeding process for the bonding experience On top of that the lifestyle changes that come with breastfeeding dont really sound appealing to meconstantly being attached to a babybreast pump having to watch my diet and alcohol intake not being able to take work trips or fun trips without pumping and having a huge frozen stash behind etc After all that formula seemed like a no brainer Science has come a long way formula has to be pretty much just as good right Until I googled formula vs breast milk and every doctor and blog and person in the universe seemed to be telling me that I was some selfish monster for depriving my baby of the liquid gold breast milk UGH I just want to preserve my sanity and a little of my independence Is formula really the worst Am I the worst for wanting this

650,priaqc,ElikotaIka,bb,3,What Birthing Classes Can Offer This was just a comment in another thread herehttpswwwredditcomrBabyBumpscommentsprkimbirthingclasses but uBeaviragohttpswwwredditcomuserBeavirago suggested I campp to make it a stand alone post so I thought I wouldand then I sort of went ham fleshing it out a little more to justify itI havent given birth yet so I cant say what a birthing class does from the perspective of having reached the finish line but my husband and I are about to start week  of the Bradley Method so I can at least explain what this class has given us so far Obviously other styles of classes will offer different info but a good class should really equip you AND YOUR PARTNER to become an effective team before during and after labor Of course this is only true to the extend that you both put effort into a class and whatever homework they give youI think when people imagine a childbirth class they largely imagine likeinstructions on pushing or how to breathe hoohooheehee or maybe some pain management techniques Or maybe they think theyre gonna have an epidural or a csection so it doesnt matter But thats not true at all There is so so much more that a good class can offer any to anyones birth experience from familiarizing you with all the medical terms youll hear in the hospital to educating you on all the procedures you may or may not want and which ones you can decline and why you might want to or not as well as practical exercise and nutrition guidelines for your pregnancy not to mention team building between the parentsWhen I say this class covers exercise and nutrition I dont mean like American diet culture but things you can do to make pregnancy more enjoyable and prepare your body for birth For example the Bradley Method is big on various daily exercises and at this stage of the class Im supposed to be doing  kegels a day god help me Prior to this week I was definitely struggling with a bit of stress incontinence peeing when Id vomit in first trimester when Id sneeze or cough or just had to go too badnot to mention a thousand bathroom breaks at night But this week I suddenly realized that Im not getting up to go to the bathroom more than twice a night anymore and I havent had any accidents either So already this class has helped me tone up my pelvic floor so much I cant imagine how strong Ill be in another  weeks of class plus  more weeks from there til my due date This gives me so much confidence about my recovery periodAside from those benefits having a strong pelvic floor is supposed to facilitate childbirth by ensuring the baby comes out headfirst if the pelvic floor is too weak they will be able to rotate and present face first a wider diameter and unable to mold which can complicate birthThe nutrition aspect of this class was also a huge help for me Bradley Method is big on protein and recommends getting gdaily We did the math and I was absolutely nowhere near that Maybe just gday during first trimester when all I could eat was fruit and yogurt and only like gday when I started the class at week  I was a little put off by how militant our instructor was about tracking our daily protein but I decided to just roll with it because thats why were taking a class and almost immediately I noticed a tremendous difference in my energy levels And it only got better after a few weeks of sustained effortThe Bradley Method is HUGE on partner participation so other classes may not emphasize that as much but with any sort of couples class your partner will at least be up to speed on what youll be going through clued in to all the struggles youll face during pregnancy be familiar with the stages of labor medical terms and so on so theyre not just likestanding around anxiously during birth Or thinking you need to rush to the hospital the second your water breaks if it breaks No class is gonna turn your partner into a doula but a good one will enable them to be a much much better support person before during and after laborTo that end our class has us do two tenminute relaxation sessions together every day where hes supposed to give me a massage or talk me through a guided meditation or practice fake contractions with role play It sounds so goofy and it definitely is a little but weve been faithful to do these every day and we really are becoming a little team Were able to talk about what does or doesnt relax me and figure out what positions help me unwind and hes getting to realize how physical his role in supporting me will besqueezing my hips rubbing my back helping me transition to various positions to labor at home regardless of your birth plan all of this is useful for the prehospital time when youre just riding out your contractions and waiting to go in Every class we get info on questions to ask our provider at our next appointment Every class we go over new relaxation techniques new laboring positions learn new medical vocabulary Its a lot Whether or not someone wants an epidural or a scheduled csection or whatever these strategies for relaxation are so relevant for coping through any situation My husband had a small medical procedure done this week and I felt really good about flipping the script and using the things wed learned to help relax him in the waiting room as he was quite anxious about it I used those same techniques helping him change his bandages this week getting him to release muscle tension and breathe through the discomfort Im so glad I know this shit Again I know not all classes will offer this same angle or go to this depth but a good class is going to educate you on the whole fucking experience so when youre in the hospital and the staff is throwing these terms about fast and loose youll be able to keep up Youll know your options And your partner will tooChildbirth classes have the potential to offer so so much more than justwhatever youd pick up in a youtube video especially in terms of creating a team dynamic between you and your partner and providing some structure for all the things you need to do to get ready our class includes packing info for hospital nursery items etc or holding you accountable on things like pelvic floor strength instead of just having to figure all that shit out on your ownAnyhow of course your miles will vary and only you know how willing youll be to participate and do the work of a class but Id like to suggest that they have so much more to offer than some rando advice on breathing

666,pr41hw,vvarmcoffee,bb,43,Frustrated Post Baby Body Expectations Information Im currently past my due date and starting to think about life postpartum I am reading Cribsheet by Emily Oster and she mentions mummy tummy or basically the loose skin and difference in your belly after youve had a baby Which seems to be very common and permanent I feel pretty at peace with my body and its changes and I wanted to look up some pictures of mummy tummy a term Ive heard many times now on Google images to get some ideas of what to expect All of the results were about makeovers plastic surgery options creams you can buy before and after basically how to pay money to fix your new stomach I was frustrated and turned to Reddit to see if I could find anything there I could find a lot more there but it was all NSFW sexual material A ton of it Which I have no great issue with other that I am unable to find any examples of postpartum bodies where the implication isnt pay money to fix this or sexualize my mom body I feel disappointed and frustrated that moms today dont get the opportunity we had in the past to see other women breastfeed give birth and move into motherhood firsthand We may have female friends and family but we dont live in the same extended family settings we did for so long and we dont have the same exposure or normalization Im sure I could find other examples of mummy tummy if I keep looking but I just feel like its bullshit that when trying to learn about our new bodies we are inundated with negativity and sexualization I dont do social media so maybe thats a better or worse place but I hope there is some platform that women are getting the message that your new body is nothing to be ashamed of

727,pqph14,MrsChiliad,bb,146,What are some cultural things that surprised you about pregnancy Inspired by the recent post on things that were surprising about pregnancy I started thinking about a few of the cultural things that have surprised me being a Brazilian who lives in the US Some positive some negative Are there any other expats here Or people who generally noticed attitudes about parenting and pregnancy that they werent expecting Here are my observations how much other women were discouraging about breastfeeding Im sure in their minds they were just trying to warn me that it doesnt work for everyone But this is largely cultural The vast majority of Brazilian moms breastfeed and the whole mentality and culture around it is completely different down there If you talk to Brazilian moms about it the main message is the first two weeks are very difficult but hold on and things get better and work out And here the message was it doesnt work for every woman theres nothing wrong with doing formula Which is true theres nothing wrong with formula But thats a very discouraging attitude to present to moms who are wanting to breastfeed people here really expect babies to be very big  and the population is taller in general so theres that But theres a noticeable bigger worry about your baby being underweight here that there isnt in Brazil Babies that simply arent chubby get called skinny here and that wouldnt be the case in Brazil My parents are always marveling at all the little rolls and dimples my now  month old has and here my husbands family are always commenting at how small my daughter is now for a big positive for the US Brazil has a sad ridiculously high rate of csections and therefore a lot of women there treat vaginal births as if it was an unattainable thing that only the most courageous of women would pursue And the marvel that I got from Brazilians from having had my daughter vaginally and without medication is not not nice But its also a little sad They think major abdominal surgery is a lesser deal than a natural process that your body was designed to go through Dont get me wrong that doesnt make birth any less of a wonder and any less difficult But this attitude that its something insurmountable is extremely hard to get rid off the minds of Brazilian women Brazilians dont generally sleep train People will either deal with their kids sleep being whatever it ends up being or they kind help them get to better sleep in different ways For example I read the book Bringing Up Beb about an Americans experiences child rearing in France and one of the things she mentions is the pause which is the habit of waiting a few minutes before going to your crying baby They do this from birth When I mentioned it to my mom she was like yes obviously thats something everyone does So a lot of babies do end up being reasonably good sleepers in Brazil without formal sleep training But I gotta say even though we implemented a lot of those things and they were helpful in nudging my daughter into being a good sleeper even before sleep training Im a BIG fan of the American way of sleep training And of putting kids to bed early which is also not a thing in BrazilEdit Thank you to everyone who replied it was really interesting reading so many different perspectives

749,prnq6k,GirlsNightOnly,bb,17,My mom criticized my birth plan and Im sad about it Im feeling really bummed right now My mom is usually really respectful of boundaries and is just generally supportive We were at dinner and my mom had had a bit to drink and she started getting weirdly emotional about wanting to know my birth plan and how she could be involved We had already discussed that only my husband and I would be there and she had respected that but she was suddenly in tears like but what if you need me I was like if I need you then husband will call you we also mentioned that we might just text my sister when I go into labor and have her text everyone so we dont have to worry about it and she again almost started crying because she wanted us to let her know personally when I was going into labor she wanted to be the one to text everyone I was like ok if this is really important to you then we will do our best to do that she is my mom after all so I do want to respect if she feels so intensely about it The conversation should have stopped there but of course then I started telling her my birth plan Im going to a midwifery center across the street from a hospital theyre affiliated and the birth center doesnt have an anesthesiologist so I would be prepping for a natural birth Both my parents kind of scoffed at that saying  Im going to regret not having one readily available I explained that its really easy and common for people to transfer across the street if they decide they need an epidural or if intervention is needed Then I mentioned I didnt want continuous fetal heart rate monitoring and my mom flipped out I read that it is linked to a higher rate of unnecessary csections but that it isnt correlated with better outcomes for the newborns I sat on trial about it for like  mins before basically storming outIts just so exhausting to have your decisions questioned and I felt like they were trying to scare me because they feel nervous about something they cant control I also felt like they were insinuating that I was taking a selfish risk by foregoing continuous heart monitoring which really upset me I obviously dont want to put my baby at risk but Im also allowed to care about my body and to be skeptical about getting sliced to high heaven if its not necessary I was prepared for this from other people and didnt plan to share broadly but this just caught me off guard My mom texted me later saying I love you dont get pissy at everyone for caring about you uhmm okay

770,pquu3k,Party_Pomplemousse,bb,12,Panic attacks over job There are going to be quite a few identifying details in this post so I may delete it in the future however Im fairly sure that no one who knows me other than my husband uses Reddit First some details to explain why Im having a hard time separating myself my job It isnt some corporation that I could leave  guilt free I work for my dad at his bar The building has been in our family for almost  years and my great grandma opened it under its current name after prohibition was lifted She was an immigrant from Slovenia and after her husband died she opened it to support her family Ill be th generation owner It is currently the oldest tavern in my city that is still owned by the same family There are three employees My father myself and my cousin We have kept it open  days a week with three people for years and we open at  am We can close anywhere from pm on slow week nights to being open until bar close when its the weekend  or its a busy weeknight This leads to very long shifts being on our feet I am currently  months  weeks pregnant and starting to really feel it I get very tired about  hours into my shift my back is starting to ache and my feet are starting to swell after standing and walking for so long Now in my third trimester my plan was to start trying to get shorter shifts or trying to be able to take a decent break during the long shifts However my cousin left us to get a job in a factory which I understand on a human level but I cant help but be miffed about his atrocious timing Like this has been fine for him for the last  years but he cant wait a few more months There was also little to zero notice First he said it could be next week or it could be two months until I find something so my dad didnt prioritize finding a replacement Of course with everywhere being so short staffed he was picked up immediately Once he had his start date He didnt tell us I finally asked his brother how the job hunt was going and found out we had less than  weeks before he started his new job So if I were to start to ease off or take the time off that I planned about a week or a little less for my husband and I to finish our nursery my dad  would be working from amclose every single day Last night was Friday the longest shift for me I get downstairs I live in the apartment above the tavern at  am bread the fish work the lunch hour and prep for dinner Then I get about an hour to eat lunch and get ready then I work the dinner shift in the kitchen from  and then I get another hour to shower change eat dinner and I work pmclose My mother bartends while I cook but she has a drinking problem She can barely stay on her feet for the  shift and gets completely wasted most of the time So when she offered to close on fridays so I could be done for the night at pm I should have known better Last night was the first night we tried it And luckily my dad took a break so he was able to come and basically babysit her he ended up having to close alone because she could barely stand for being so drunk and that brings up that my dad also cant say no to customers buying him drinks and shots He gets totally wasted too Which wasnt usually a problem because I could handle it I was sober I could come in he could leave and nothing was an issue  Also I said to my mom I dont think this is going to work and she yelled at me in front of all the customers that I was looking down on her and judging her Ive been having panic attacks hyperventilating crying bursting blood vessels in my face any time that I am not actively distracting myself because I dont see a day off in sight Just an endless stream of extremely long shifts of being on my feet My mom has been telling me its not your problem dont stress dad and I will handle it But theyve proven time and time again that I cant count on them Plus my mom has a full time job my dad cant be on his feet that long either and neither of them can resist the temptation of the alcohol My dad is worried that if he doesnt drink with his friends and customers that they will stop coming He refuses to ever close for a day even though bars and restaurants all over the city close regularly when they dont have people to work And I cant shake the feeling of absolute wracking guilt when Im upstairs working in my apartment to make it babyready and I can hear how busy it is and that he is by himself probably drunk and tired too I was always the goto girl I could work endless shifts any time before I was in the third trimester but Im just tired now My body is starting to not be able to handle the workload It makes me feel so awful just typing that out like it makes me feel lazy or weak I am currently training my husbands nephew  to take over for my cousins hours but he does also have a full time job and the schedule is already set there for quite some time So until he can work it out with his other job we have no one I feel like this is supposed to be happy time in my life I just want to have the time and energy to nest and its only going to get harder as the weeks go on I cant stop crying I cant shake the stress headaches and I cant even read my baby books without thinking that Ill never have time to prepare and spiraling into another panic attack My husband also works full time to keep our insurance he helps out all the time works  hours a week shoulders equal house work He is the most amazing partner in the world and he has been offering to take hours on top of his understaffed full time job as a kitchen manager in a huge busy restaurant just to ease my stress but I cant ask him to do that I dont want him to work himself to absolute death I wont let him He loves me so much and would do anything for me I know it hurts him to see me hurting so badI guess I just wanted to shout into the void Thank you if youve read this far and if you live in my city and recognize me from the details in this post please dont let me know I have to get ready for work now Have a good day everyone Please be kind to your service workers Its hard out here

for something fun and not me venting Buckle up buttercups cause Ive got a lot to get off my chest And Im giving the least detailed version I can Some info Im currently expecting a little girl with my boyfriend on November st currently  weeks days Heres a tldr for ya yeah Im just straight up losing it I just cant take this stress anymore This entire pregnancy has been stressful I had just moved into my boyfriends apartment with his absolutely horrible roommate when I found out I was pregnant Were luckily no longer living with him but I had to get through the worst of my pregnancy while living with someone who smoked in the apartment and let their dog use the common area as its toilet My boyfriend and I had a lot of fights over this because it caused us so much stress but we got through itI had some pretty awful nausea vomiting and some weird digestive issues for the first half of my pregnancy that resulted in me losing  lbs very fast and looking extremely ill all the time Im still not entirely sure the reason for the painful digestion but there came a time when both my partner and I would be crying over me trying to eat a few bites of plain rice knowing it was going to cause me pain and I would most likely throw it up We came so close a few times to my needing to be hospitalized But we got through that too Im still dealing with random puking occasionally and every day nausea but its so much more manageable now Also still struggling to gain weight but our little girl seems to be doing okay I had to leave my job as a bartenderserver because the stress of it became too much Mostly I couldnt deal with being on my feet for several hours with no break trying to do several jobs at the same time and then getting on a train with no seats and no one offering a visibly unwell pregnant woman a seat Then the birth center I was planning to stay with ended up being liars I chose them because of their almost nonexistent transfer rate and how calm they made their center seem Cut to me in my rd trimester finding out they transfer all the time to the point of being notorious about it Then they email me at am saying I will most likely be sent to the hospital when its my time to give birth because theyre severely understaffed I have dreamed of having a baby at either a birth center or at home for so long I will go to the hospital if I have to but thats not the path I want And to tell me I cant give birth there because of being understaffed while also having guests come in to interview and check out the space I would wait for my appointment while hearing them tell someone all the things they changed their mind on with me just does not sit well with me They did this same thing to a friend who is due to give birth this month and she also had her own issues and chose to not go with them So now my partner and I have chosen a new homebirth midwife but thanks to insurance issues and with this happening so late in my pregnancy we need to raise up a lot of money very quickly to pay the costs Then Ida hit and our apartment flooded Im still too weak to really do much but helped as much as I could when it happened Now our apartment slightly smells of mold and Im guessing sarcasm thats not good for the baby A wonderful friend started a go fund me that has meant a lot to us More than money Its partially saved my sanity Im not good at asking for help Ive always been the loner type thats gotten by with just myself so to see so many people help brought me to tears and I started to feel hopeful Then tonight I sat in my still wrecked apartment smelling mold and yet again struggled to work on this god awful registry and wonderedwhy do I think I have any right to be this childs mother I cant even finish this registry that Ive worked on for months now I have no source of income and my partner is working like a dog to keep us afloat I feel so guilty bringing a child into this mess My anxiety and depression is at an all time high and Im pretty sure Im losing it My daughter deserves better Im trying so hard to stay positive and be thankful especially to my friends and everyone who has helped us and offered any form of kindness But man I feel like the universe is against this kid and I just cant take one more bad thing I want to give her the world and I have nothing for her Ive had very little time to actually enjoy this pregnancy and feel any sort of joy towards bringing my baby into the world So put your hands in the air and wave them like you just care too much so now you just dont care at all and posted your messy registry online that doesnt even have half the stuff you actually need cause youve officially lost your mind and have decided to just keep the kid on your boobs at all times and hope for the best Hot mess moms and moms to be let me know you exist so Im not alone If youve read all of this and you sympathize god I love you Please know Im with you

836,pqaojl,eviefb,bb,19,Feel like Ill never get past this vent Trigger warning sexual abuse CSA Long post my apologies I was raped twice in my life once at  and once at  So many parts of life that people go into with minimal issues such as maintaining friendships dating and relationships Ive had to battle with Ive been through hours upon hours of therapy filled at least ten journals Ive read all the books and watched all the ted talks on trauma I thought I was past the worst of it For what its worth the thing that helped me the most was developing strategies to deal with my anxiety and becoming comfortable with setting boundaries My mantra is that I dont have to allow anyone to touch me if I dont want them to Now I feel like Im back to square one Ive always wanted to be a mother and have a baby Ive always been fascinated with pregnancy and childbirth and want to experience that Im under no delusion that it will be comfortable and easy all the time But now that Ive gotten to a point in my life where becoming pregnant on purpose is a real possibility and Ive been seriously considering all the implications Im afraid that I cant do it I can kind of wrap my head around another being occupying and changing my body for nine months its okay if I invited it in But then theres the doctors appointments which will involve physical examinations whether Im comfortable with them or not Childbirth where Im nude from the waist down potentially for hours nurses in and out of the room and every so often someone sticks their hand up my vagina All while Im in pain and extremely vulnerable Then when the babies born I have to strip down even further to do skin to skin and Ill have to breastfeed soon after Then the breastfeeding lasts for at least the next six months And I dont mean to imply that I see anything inherently sexual about breastfeeding quite simply its another being making demands on my body when I dont feel comfortable with it Id rather just formula feed from the start but thats so frowned upon that I dont think Id be able to Its sometimes difficult to separate loving touch from the type of touch that traumatized me I still struggle with this on occasion with my partner I know that anything can be conquered with the right mindset and a lot of therapy I guess Im just upset that I need to go that route to just feel comfortable with having a baby it seems like something that so many others take for granted Its just so unfair If you made it this far thanks for listening If anyone has been through anything similar please let me know I swear its like Im the only one

873,ppkjr3,hopefulpregnancy,bb,89,Ive had a Failed Abortion and Im Grateful and Hopeful As Im posting this Im  weeks pregnant and sitting in a high risk ward of the hospital until delivery  My story is an odd one and as Im sharing it I know it may be removed but Im hoping maybe someone has had an experience like this and can give me some peace of mindguidance as Googling babies who have survived failed abortions isnt exactly fruitful  In  my bf and Is relationship was failing  My best friend kissed me which bf didnt know about and quickly I planned to leave  Except I didnt  We worked on our relationship and grew but when I attempted to end the side partnership yes I know it quickly turned into sexual coercion and assault  For a year  I wont post all the details just please understand it was incredibly abusive and I felt like my relationship with bf was the only good thing I had in my life  The only reason Im explaining this part is to help you understand why the abortion was attempted  Things are more complicated and insidious than they seem  May this year I discovered I was pregnant  I was angry hurt scared I didnt want bf to raise a child that wasnt his I was already being unfair to him this this I couldnt oblige  I didnt and dont have periods consistently so I didnt know HOW pregnant I was  So living in a restricted access state I got the abortion pills online  Through a trusted website  A few weeks later they arrived and they worked I thought  Insane cramps the heaviest bleeding I ever went through I almost passed out from the pain  Then I tested negative on a pregnancy test  All clear so I thought  A few weeks ago I started cramping heavily  Like abortion pill heavy but no bleeding aside from spotting  Heavy mucus etc  I thought a cyst had ruptured and not drained properly  Eventually I went to the ERAre you pregnant they asked and I confidently said no  Until they did the ultrasound  I was VERY pregnant and the gestational age it was my bfs  The one person I did want a child with the love of my life   I had tried to abort this sweet sweet child  But theres a problem  My cervix is gone  Just gone you see that cramping was labor pains  So I get sent to a specialized hospital where Im sitting now and a week later my amniotic sac is trying to make its way into my vagina  For now Im on meds to prevent labor intense bed rest and constant monitoring  Im so homesick but more than that Im scared  I wish Id knew then what I know now how my little one seeing that ultrasound well it tore me apart  Ive always been and still am pro choice but all I can think about it how Im supposed to protect this baby from the world and I may have caused them so much harm  Its terrifying  Theyve told me the ultrasounds my biology aside look great babies development looks great etc  But Im scared  What if she comes out and doesnt live long because of what I did  What if shes born too premature   I have so many fears but also so much love and hope Ive never felt so fiercely  Im not religious but every kick from my child feels like a gift from God himselfI just frankly needed to tell someone my story but also if anyone has been through something similar I would love to hear yours  I understand if this community doesnt take kindly to it but I dont know where else to share
874,ppoovh,Gullible_Meat5659,bb,27,Graduated  unexpected preterm labor no risk factors vaginal birth NICU I live in rural Australia in a town of about  people with a small hospital I had a very normal pregnancy our baby has always measured perfectly average and I havent had any complications with my pregnancy I didnt have any risk factors indicating that I was likely to have a preterm birth September had a regular day working from home and at PM started having gentle contractions ish minutes apart Id started having contractions in the last week so figured this was normalAt PM I tried to poop and felt mucus come out wiped and it was lumpy and pink with streaks of blood I thought maybe I had strained too hard because it was my th time pooping that day after being constipated for the past few monthsMy contractions were also getting a bit stronger so I ran a hot bath and that felt awesome on my back It felt like my hips were about to explode out of my skin and like I had the worst gas and bloating ever and if I could just fart it would feel better While I was in the bath I lost a little bit more mucus with streaky bloodI wasnt that worried about the mucus and blood and planned to sleep on it because I though it was just something normal for this time My husband convinced me to contact our midwife just to check My husband also noticed my belly had gotten lower and it was feeling harderI texted the midwife that so far I was getting inconsistent contractions that seemed to be getting more painful My belly had dropped lower My belly was getting hard when I had contractions I lost some lumpy pink mucus with streaks of blood Id pooped a lot that day a sign of impending labour I hadnt had sex or done anything strenuous enough to irritate my cervix and cause contractionsShe immediately called me back and told me to come to hospital to have a checkupAt pm we headed to our local hospital and got put into a birthing room and had a rapid COVID test negative yay They strapped a heartbeat monitor and something else that I think measures contractions to my belly Our babys heartbeat was nice and healthy and at this point I was having contractions every  minutes that were getting stronger every with every contraction After that they did a urine test and blood test Im not sure what forThe next test was taking a swab of my cervix to check whether labour was progressing Once they put the speculum in a bunch of blood gushed out and a blood clot the size of my big toe They didnt tell me until we had a briefing after I gave birth but I was already cm dilated here They gave me a pad and at the point I was cursing myself for wearing sexy underwear to a hospital checkup that were not adequate for a maternity pad to stick to The contractions continued getting worse and had peaked at  seconds every   minutes The doctor came back to do an ultrasound and saw that our baby was head down legs up in my ribs and engaged downward The midwife explained to me that my cervical swab results came back significantly high to show that I was progressing toward being in labour At this point they administered my first steroid injection to strengthen babys lungs and gave me some antibiotics through an IV in case there was some infection causing early labour that hadnt been detectedIt was decided that as we live in rural Australia we were going to be airlifted to a hospital in the city as our local hospital doesnt have a NICU and the other hospital will have more resources to try and slow down labour At PM they gave me two tablets of nifedipine to dilate my blood vessels and stop my uterus from contracting hopefully to buy us time before the ambulance came to take me to the airportMy husband and I decided it would be best if he drove to the hospital instead of coming in the plane so we could actually get back home as the hospital we were being transferred to was a  hour drive He left to organise getting our pets taken care of and pack a hospital bagAt PM and PM I had  more tablets total of nifedipine They also gave me a single tablet of oxycodone and paracetamol for the pain from contractions although I didnt ask for the painkillers they were just handed to me and watched me take it I was finally airlifted at AM to the nearest hospital with a NICU ward and arrived at AM We were immediately transferred into a birthing suite where they took my vitals and strapped a monitor to me and my contractions were still lasting  seconds every   minutes At AM the OB decided to do a cervical check with a speculum I was still cm dilated so the nifedipine had successfully stalled labor for some time However It was unlikely that it was going to stop at this point and this baby was definitely going to come within the next week but they decided that they werent going to give me anything else to slow it down anymore It was good that they gave me the nifedipine earlier that night as it bought us time to get to another hospitalA few hours passed and we got a little sleep then from am continued to have monitoring of blood pressurefetal heart ratecontractions My contractions actually slowed to once every  minutes at this point so we were hopeful that we would get a few more days of development in my womb They also did a bedside ultrasound in this time and measured his head circumference to be cm and was bearing down onto my cervix hardBut by am the contractions picked back up to every  minutes They did a cervical check with fingers and I was now cm dilated and  effaced At am I took a couple paracetamol tablets to try and slow down the contracting and manage the pain in advance and things went very quickly from hereBy pm I had started with nitrous oxide gas for the pain It honestly didnt really numb the pain in my experience but just made everything seem like a bad dream so I could disassociate from what was happening It also gave me a way to focus on my breathing My contractions were lasting longer than a minute and were every  minutesThe midwife did another cervical check with fingers at pm and I was cm dilated and  effaced and he was bearing down so hard there was only the waters sac membrane flush against his head Given the circumference of his head the midwife said as soon as the waters break he is going to come out very quicklyI was moaning through the contractions and if I recommend anything that helps its doing thisThe midwife told me to start pushing to try and break my waters because they didnt want to manually break them as the membrane was right against his head They broke so quickly that my midwife didnt have a chance to put on her safety glasses they absolutely EXPLODED all over her and my husband it was so comical The feeling of trying to break my waters was like a full rubber balloon being pulled out through my vagina and then just a gush of fluid It didnt hurt just felt super strangeI began pushing at pm and my son was born at pm on  September I was only pushing for  minutes and I didnt tear or graze probably because he was so tiny Pushing is the biggest test of willpower I have ever experienced The midwife would tell me to stop pushing and hold him there or I would tear Its so hard to do but it didnt hurt when I stopped pushing and held I found that the burning sensation only happened when I was pushingWhen he came out they put him onto my chest for a minute before clamping the cord My husband cut the cord and I probably got to hold him for all of two minutes until they took him away and started putting tubes down his throat and into his arms and torso My placenta came out really fast after and I didnt have anyone massage my belly or pull to get it out it just came out itself and it felt like losing a blood clot it wasnt painfulOne of us had to accompany our son to the NICU to give consent to all the procedures they were about to do and it obviously wasnt going to be me so my husband had to pick himself up from being distraught and crying on the floor after seeing our son go through that to go to the NICU I was alone in the birthing room aside from the occasional midwife coming in to adjust some hormone infusion that helped my uterus contract I didnt see my husband for  hours when he was able to come back and help me shower and I was discharged to the postnatal ward for the nightDuring the entire labor and birth our son never showed any signs of distress like he didnt even know what was happening  I didnt see my son for  hours after giving birth and I wasnt able to hold him for  days and even still I can only hold him once a day for an hour or so Hes had a few hiccups but is doing great otherwise We are expecting to be here for  weeks and are living in accomodation provided by the hospitalThey still dont know why I went into labor and I dont think well ever know which is scary Im terrified of going through this again Theres nothing I could have done to prevent it there were no signsI wanted to share my story of how random it can be and Id love to hear from anyone else that went through the same Im grateful that things went as well as they did
875,pq1jla,Fires246,bb,4,Dealing with a  cm fibroid  kidney stones long post Hi everyoneWe feel we should share this experience to help others who might be in a similar situationMy partner the pregnant lady  knew she had a  cm fibroid back in  She never really followed up on it because she had no symptoms whatsoever and was told it would impact fertility mostly  nothing was said about might come during pregnancyShe also was diagnosed quite young with kidney stones small ones in each kidney and has kept close monitoring due to pyelonephritis kidney infectionFlash forward  years and were now expecting yay The first trimester was fine no nausea no vomiting so she was quite lucky in that senseOn the second trimester  weeks pregnant she woke up at  am with abdominal pain and was not able to fall back asleep She felt it might just be growing pains and thought she would wait to see if it went away It didntSecond night the pain is increasing no amount of paracetamol is helping and were starting to worryThird night agony We called  non emergency line in the UK requesting advice worried for the babys wellbeing At this point shes wondering if she might be passing a stone or if something else is wrong After a bit of research the fibroid seem to be suspect number  replied they were too busy and would call us back  they never didThe next day she wasnt feeling better It was the weekend so we called  again and they advised us to see an out of hours GP With all of this she was sleeping from pure exhaustion in blocks of  min up to h and a total of h per night mainly thanks to scalding hot baths Shes also unable to eat and morale is deflating The pain was definitely worse at night or after eatingWe go to the out of hours clinic which she really wanted to avoid because of Covid and all other potential contamination but it we really had to see someone about this After h waiting the nurse that saw her didnt even know from triage that she was pregnant and asked why she didnt try ibuprofen Once she explained all of her story the nurse replied oh well you have fibroids plus kidney stones plus a baby in the belly all of that takes a lot of space its normal youre uncomfortable you think Go check with your midwife asap as I cant do anything for you not even a scan since youre not bleeding nor have you got a feverWe went back home completely devastated Shes thinking about terminating the pregnancy because the baby is just going to continue growing and probably the pain will as well and she cant spend  more months without sleeping eating and if the pain increases she will just pass out or go crazy The discussion took place and we both agreed that anyway we couldnt continue like thisThroughout these days I just felt a complete sense of powerlessness She was there in front of me in pain for several days crying and I couldnt do anything about it Its disheartening I almost went out to try to find some marijuana or something that could help ease the pain I was that desperate I didnt in the endThe only lifeline we had was to know that we had already a private scan booked to find out the babys gender and they would also do a quick health check Also we had an obstetrician appointment to monitor her pregnancy with kidney stones She had almost cancelled that appointment a few months ago from feeling so well Thank God she didntAt the scan we found out we were having a boy We were filled with joy but still werent sure if we were going to go through with it if no solution presented itself The scan revealed the baby was healthy but there were multiple fibroids and the biggest one was now  cm big She was experiencing mild hydronephrosis urine going back to the kidneys and was advised to seek medical attention promptly In a couple of days the obstetrician appointment was up and it felt like a glimmer of hope We just had to go through  more nightsI dont know how she coped with sleeping that little and in pain I wasnt sleeping well or enough either and I felt like crap Shes a real warriorWednesday arrives and we go and see the obstetrician Shes crying in the waiting room because so far no one had been able to help and also showed little compassion We texted a friend who is an obstetrician who told us that anyway there wasnt much to do for the pain but a stent could be put in for the urine That thought was just not enough she needed the pain to stopWe waited longer than we should and saw the waiting room ebb and flow because the doctors were discussing her case Good sign we thoughtWe finally go in and theres  doctors in the room The main consultant who was also pregnant and  students  The appointment didnt start well with the obstetrician saying that everything looked fine No infection no bleeding That was good news but it wasnt going to take the pain away which is what we wanted We explained that she couldnt sleep nor eat nor cope and it was only when she asked about terminating the pregnancy which wasnt bluff with tears in her eyes that the room got silent the doctors eyes widened and they said okay this is what were going to do a prescription for dehydrocodeine  paracetamol was given Her name was written on a board at the gynaecology ward for an emergency morphine shot andor catheter for urine evacuation They also booked a scan to review the fibroids and kidney stones and check if there was nothing elseA sense of relief filled us They explained to us that the pain she was experiencing was similar to a constant calf cramp  blocked urine  blocked intestines Thats intense Basically they think the fibroid is dying red degeneration because the baby is taking its blood supply and this pain lasts for a total of about  to  weeks but should never last more than that After that it goes away and reduces in sizeWe went home still in pain but feeling so much better moralewise from feeling like being taken care of and heard That night she even ate more than soup and had some smoked salmon and eggs to celebrate Also she wanted to have something more consistent in her stomach for the painkillersIt took h for the painkiller to take action She went for a hot bath while waiting to give some relief in the meantime and thats when things took a turn we werent expecting She was experiencing the most severe heartburn passing out for a few seconds sweating profusely dry mouth the works I helped her by raising her arms and giving her some apple cider vinegar Once she got a bit of her strength back I lifted her out of bed so she could stand up It took  minutes but she was like nothing had happened aside from being exhausted And finally she sleptSorry for the long story We hope this helps other couples Do not give up and keep pushing when you feel no ones listening to you Sometimes public services are not equipped for everyones problemsTLDR Partner has a big fibroid during pregnancy experienced severe pain couldnt sleep for a week After much insisting with doctors finally got painkillers and is now feeling a bit better Shes probably experiencing red degeneration and might as well be passing a kidney stone not sure yet

945,pom6zn,JaneEyre1987,bb,555,Im going to red pill a few women on here your husbands inability to do basic things regarding baby is on purpose Were you born knowing how to change diapers Were you born knowing how to research baby products Were you born knowing how to grocery shop Were you born knowing how to take care of newborns Were you born knowing how to manage a household No No one was but we decided to learn how to do these things If your husband doesnt know how to do basic adult things to help prepare for baby or to create a good co parenting dynamic its because HE DOESNT WANT TO Its not because he doesnt know or because it not his skill set its because he doesnt want to And he will do things badly so that you never ask him to do said thing again Please stop making excuses for men who just flat out refuse to step up and be involved coparents and hold them accountable If youre newly pregnant its not ridiculous to expect your partner to participate in this process its not ridiculous to expect them to put time and effort into preparing for this baby Its the bare minimum If we wouldnt think it was cute for a women to be uninvolved in the preparation of her babys arrival its not cool for a man either Please for the love of the pope and all that is good can we hold men to a higher standard

9,pvvgn0,esmereldaskysurfer,mom,47,Its actually frightening the advice people will give out online In a Facebook group a mum posts about her  month old having a little trouble passing stool after starting solids In a baby that young the only advice you should be giving is if youre concerned talk to your pediatrician nurse line Or maybe suggest foods that help them go like prunes etcBut people were telling her to feed her  month old baby cola syrup or flat cola and my favourite cut a stick of soap off a bar of soap microwave it so its soft and insert it into their rectum I pointed out that this is dangerous af and she started ranting about how soap enemas are scientifically proven to work and doctors recommend them Uhh an enema is when you mix the soap with water and it goes up the bum And I STILL would not recommend doing that to a  month old without direct permission from a medical professional Shoving a microwaved chunk of soap up their ass is not in any way an enema and has a high chance of them ending up in hospital for a foreign body lodged in rectum kind of xray when a piece breaks off and wont come out

32,pw1xcc,SouthParkTaughtMe,mom,66,What was the oddest gift at your baby shower or just in general Its been over  years since but Im still boggled by this one When we were pregnant with  my mom received gifts because WE were pregnant Thats right  SHE was given gifts You mught be thinkingDo we live with her  NoWas she going to be our source of Daycare  NoWas the baby going to be spending time at their house without us there  NoYou know what the gifts wereOne gift basket of goodies like diaper rash cream wipes random stuff that the PARENTS TO BE would need NOT the grandparents Someone also gave her a gently used pack n play Was this given in turn to give to us It most certainly was not It was given to them to keep at their house WHY We got a brand new pack n play that we took with us when needed We never even talked about the baby sleeping over at their house I dont get it It must be something about that generation They automatically assumed the grandparents would be the ones raising the child So they needed baby shower gifts of their own I have no freaking idea We always took with us everything we needed everywhere we went And I eneded up taking that pack n play their weirdo friend gave them and gave it to our day care because it was in good shape and would ACTUALLY BE USED as she was in need of one And most of that stuff she got in the gift basket ended up going to waste as it was never usedMy kiddo is over three now and I still dont understand the logic in it And ya I know it sounds selfish but WE were the parents to be Why wouldnt they just give us those thingsFurther on that my dad wanted to put together this older than Caesar crib together to have in their house I told him no  Because I dont trust an old as dirt crib  We were NOT going to be using it as we had no intention of the baby sleeping over So its gotta be an odd thing about their generationAnyone else experience something similar Its like a kid at someone elses birthday party whose mom gives him a gift to not make him feel left out

44,pvmxvj,Badger-Ledger,mom,4,My reflections on becoming a more confident and selfrespecting parent Motherhood is hardToday I realized that perhaps its because Im thinking about it all wrong This morning I took my  month old son to the doctor for his routine check up I walked away feeling guilty and inadequate The doctor was wonderful and he gave good advice In fact he gave the same solid textbook advice I used to give other parents before I became a parent myself My feeling of unsettlement after our perfectly good appointment made me realize  things  I used to give shitty advice under the guise of expertise and  I need to change my mindset about parenting or else Im going to live the next  years feeling like a failure Now that I am a parent I can appreciate how damaging  can be All the experts who try to help us raise our kids mean well And most of the time their efforts to help do make us better parents But sometimes they make us worse parents by planting seeds or self doubt and a sense of inadequacy This was a bit of a rude awakening for me since it became quite clear to me that Ive probably inadvertently ruined many parents self esteem while trying to be helpful But it was really my second realization that left a bigger impact on me As Ive said parenting is hard Im tired Im physically tired from lack of sleep Im emotionally tired of not being able to calm down my baby when hes miserable Im mentally tired from having to perform well at my demanding job and not being able to vegout after coming home In trying to find a solution to my fatigue and to get general tips on being a better mom I read lots of books articles and blogs about how to be a good and successful parent Ive come away from all this research with goals Goals to sleep train to nick contact naps to reduce night time wakings to practice EC to use cloth diapers to breastfeed to limit cosleeping to be able to perform well at work and the like These were my top goals Some of them I was able to accomplish It wasnt ever easy but I got it done Some of those goals however seemed absolutely impossible to me I now realize that this is because my goals were all wrong They needed to be reframed because my actual goals were completely different I didnt need to sleep train my baby I just wanted to feel rested enough to function at work and still be a present mother I didnt need my baby to peepoo in the potty I just wanted a less messy less rashy more sustainable diapering solution I didnt need to exclusively breastfeed it just happened to be the easiest way for ME to feed MY baby And I could cosleep as after reviewing the literature Ive come to the conclusion that the higher risk of SIDS associated with cosleeping was worth the many benefits I was getting from it ie helping me accomplish my other goals  Reframing my goals made me feel much more adequate confident happy and optimistic I knew there was just no way I could get my baby to stop contact napping and waking up every  hours at night to feed despite the doctors suggestion that if I really tried we would get there I had tried previously it was torture for all parties involved and it just wasnt worth it at least not at this time We will try again later but for now I am going to focus on the things I have control over in my pursuit of feeling more rested For me that means cosleeping working with my sleeping baby wrapped around my waist and doubling up on my tea intake  For you the way you accomplish a similar goal may look completely different We need to find the answers to how to reach our goals within ourselves rather than trying to copy what others are doing  Read a lot seek out expert opinions listen to current recommendations gather data but dont lose sight of what your parenting goals actually are Dont let your goals get lost and confused among the downpour of parenting advice youre exposed to  Determine what it is that youre really trying to accomplish and ask yourself how can YOU get this done You can use what you learned from others to better your strategy but only use the pieces of advice that fit It is counterproductive to try to implement solutions that dont work for you It was so surprising to me how the simple act of reframing my goals erased so much of the anxiety I have been feeling about being a new mom I hope sharing my story helps others feel the same You got this

54,pvourk,savvyroma,mom,11,Not sure the best community this is for Needing to vent about my own mom Not sure how to sum up such a chaotic relationship I am  Mom is pushing  I think Neither of my parents were role models My mom lucked into a job at local newspaper for most of me being in school So I viewed her as overall successful and smart She was a huge pothead that never tried to hide it from me but never really drank Dad was unemployed much of that time and I never valued his role in the family as he was severely depressed and didnt clearly contribute the way he could have She was always present with my problems that I wanted to confide with her in She helped me with homework She had a temper and would lose it from time to time Overall they were both irresponsible with money I knew their relationship was on its last legs they slept in seprate rooms most of what I remember and didnt do much togetherSo when it came time for me to go to college I did I wanted nothing more than to be away from my dysfunctional parents that leaned on their daughter in a way that was maybe not unreasonable but also not normal I didnt do well in college I decided to drop out after  quarters My boyfriend said I could stay with him and though hesitant I knew it was better then going back to their homeWithin months of that move my mom started seeing some random guy and like that they were divorcing It should also be mentioned she was layed off from her newspaper job This was extremely stressful My mom was happy to be away from dad so all seemed well for her while dad started making comments about his time of dying I did not handle that for long before I told him that it was too much information and we would need to avoid these topics when talking He ended up losing contact for a good portion of time We reconnected and overall have a good relationshipI would see mom and her new boyfriend semi regularly his vibes were off but I wasnt sure why but seemed friendly enough I kept him at a distance and didnt read much into it knowing my mom also carried a lot of baggage Time went on and mom seemed to mentally be deteriorating She started drinking a lot in addition to the smoking One day my boyfriend and I met them at a museum and they showed up late and drunk It was a very awkward afternoon Wierd random red flags continued to pop up She started getting caught stealing from cash registers at a rite aid job she had we found a job at a call center my boyfriends mom worked at it was beleived that she was drinking in the bathroom on the job and let go EctAs time went on I eventually found myself pregnant with my st child I was scheduled to be induced she insisted on being there even though I wasnt terribly excited When the night came for my appoitment they didnt have room we knew and communicated this was a possibility the whole day of communication with her was a mess she calls me that night to say heeey Im at the hospital After some back and forth we finally dicided she would stop by the house to say hi before going back into the city to wait She was clearly messed up and incoherent Let me reiterate my mother was going to show up to the hospital for the birth of my child at the very best super drunk It was becoming clear the problem may be more then drinking We talked the next day about my disappointment and how this could not happenOver the next few years I try to keep her at a distance She clearly had a problem she didnt want to address that her boyfriend was feeding into There came a point where it all came to a high point It came out that her and the boyfriend got in a fight and he hit her Which clicked a lot of missing linkshe was probably beating her most of the time Weird injuries I thought she was getting because she was drunk or on drugs or whatever were from him We pushed her to leave We pushed her to go to a treatment center She did the bare minimum and left treatment She insisted she loved him and stayed with him anyway Within the year of all of that he has a major stroke and ends up in a wheelchair Spends several months like that Passed away just a month or two agoShe is now on her own She asked me for some money Im not really in a place to give her money but can find some to spareIf you have read this far this is where Im looking for guidance at what point do I cut her out of my life The stress of being in contact not knowing what she will be like how the boys will be around her  and  yo what crazy happening will be happening in her life ect It getting to be to much However I cant shake the possibility that if I say mom I cant do this anymore let me know when you get your shit together that Ill find out she was found dead somewhere in months I feel tons of guilt but also dont want her around the kids most the time I dont want to see her anymore And then I feel terrible about feeling that way Any supportguidancetips anything at all would be appretiated Im lost

117,purnx9,Idkausername111,mom,6,Anyone else overwhelmed with all the toys I have an insane amount of toys and the best storage solution I have is a cubical with bins There isnt enough storage for all of them though so its usually looking pretty messy throughout the week I can get it to look nice for approximately  minutes while my daughter naps and then its destroyed right after she wakes up which is understandable as Im not going to ban her from playing with the toys just so it will look nice Ive been wanting to go through them and donate or throw away all of the toys that are not played with or broken The problem is that I babysit kids ages  months years old So the toys that some kids have grown out of the younger ones will play with So Ive been left with an ungodly amount of toys that I cant justify getting rid of What are your toy storage solutions if you have a ton of toys Ive thought about getting another cubicle or a bigger one but thats really my only idea at the moment

139,pua7kh,Emerald_Mistress,mom,16,Can we talk about toddler tantrums One of my twins yo threw a massive tantrum tonight because daddy wouldnt pick her up after sister took her toy To be clear its not that he refused to pick her up its that he asked her to walk over to him rather than him going and picking her up She does it all the time she wants you to come to her and pick her up rather than coming over to you which is another issue entirely Anyway  my husband is of the mindset that tantrums should be ignored and not reinforced and that once shes calmed down and isnt screaming and flailing about we can talk about having big feelings I feel like ignoring her while shes having a tantrum is just teaching her that she cant express her feelings around us He worries that if we interact with the tantrum theyll just get longer and worse We kind of met in the middle and sat in the floor near her while she screamed and flailed I intervened a couple times so she wouldnt kick me or her sister Every few minutes I would pick up a toy and play with it and ask her to help me and eventually she decided the puzzle was a better activity than the tantrum but it was a good ish minutes before she finally stopped Im sorry this was so longwinded Thank you for listening and if you have any tips or advice what worked for you I would really appreciate it

141,publ4l,Idkausername111,mom,5,Anyone elses SO get jealous when you are praised for being a good mom Little bit of a backstory my boyfriend and I have a one year old together The first  months were very rocky for us We would bicker over the smallest things I was always overwhelmed and cranky He was always working and tired when he got home Hes quite a neat freak so when he would get home it was always why is the house so messy and it would piss me off to no end I babysit in my home so its either a clean house or hurt toddlers because I was away from them cleaning Ive always just cleaned up the house after the kids leave While our house is never spotless it would look presentable through the week On the weekends I try to give the house a really good clean depending on if our daughter would allow me to clean The past few months have been better I think were both adjusting to everything finally And then today happened Yesterday and today Ive had to leave the house right after all the kids left so I havent had the chance to clean the house up like I usually do I got home today we sat down and ate had a regular happy evening I went to give our daughter a bath and as I was walking past him he says I see you didnt clean the house I said uh no I had to leave right after the kids left He said you didnt clean yesterday either once again I explained that I had to leave and didnt have time to pick up the tornado of toys that the kids left I told him I was going to pick up as soon as I got her dressed I start to pick up the living room and she gets fussy like shes tired so I sit down to nurse her so she can go to bed I figured it would be easier to clean up after she went to sleep anyways As Im nursing her he comes in and picks the toys up and puts them all in the middle of the living room He doesnt know where everything goes since I have a certain way of putting the toys up I wouldnt mind him helping but he seemed to be very pissy while he was doing it I said thank you for getting the toys Im going to pick up after she lays down Just give me a minute Dont worry about it He doesnt even acknowledge that Im talking to him I ask what his problem is no response Ask twice more sill nothing as he walks out of the living room After a couple minutes our daughter is finally asleep so I go to lay her down in her room and I walk by him and I tell him once again that I am going to tidy up the house once I lay her down Hes still acting pissed off so I say I dont know why youre being shitty towards me I told you I was going to pick up and I am going to I get her laid down and walk back to pick up the living room and he says call me shitty again wont get you very far so I said I didnt call YOU shitty I was saying you were being shitty TO me I asked you what was wrong  times and you ignored me He goes I said nothing well I didnt hear you but I asked  times so you couldve said it louder But theres obviously something wrong Then I go on to say idk if youre pissed because the house isnt clean but I told you I was going to clean it up Ive been gone right after the kids leave for two days so I havent had time to pick up He says Im picking up right now and you just called me shitty for it I said I didnt call you shitty for picking up youre ignoring me and acting pissed off so I said you were treating me shittyHere comes the mind boggling part Im in the living room picking up and he walks back in and says and Im sick of the social media single mom bullshit at this point Im like wtf is he talking about He goes on to say youre always posting about YOUR kid and you never tag me in anything about her and everyone is always commenting on how great of a mom you are and nobody says anything about me So Im completely taken aback by this hes never said anything to me before in the entire year shes been on this earth about me posting on social media I always post on Instagram and it automatically posts on Facebook but I never tag him because  It doesnt automatically tag people so I always forget And  I didnt figure he wanted my posts clogging up his wall since hes complained before about how many postsmemes I share The part about my kid was one single post where I said I have the cutest kid in the world or something like that I tell him Im sorry I didnt know you wanted to be tagged And I honestly didnt even think or mean anything by posting that I have the cutest kid I dont control what other people comment on my posts if you want to be praised then why dont you post her He goes on this long rant about how posting on social media doesnt make you a great parent and all of this Which I agree I mainly post for my family members who I havent seen in a while to get updates on our daughter I asked him what he wanted me to do about it and he walked away and went to bed So that was a great time with absolutely no resolution Idk what the point of this was I just needed to rant and to see if anyone elses SO have been annoyed by social media I really didnt think it was that big of a deal since hes never said anything before I went through all of my posts of our daughter and tagged him in them after he went to bed I tried to hear him out and wanted to help make him feel better but he just left Its not like I actively hide him from my page weve been together for  years Its says were in a relationship Ill tag him in stuff occasionally that I think is funny or whatever Im going to start tagging him in our daughters stuff now too AITA here Is anyone

164,pu1ug4,Redifar,mom,5,How do I handle my childs emotions of feeling less loved Hi parents today my daughter told me something that completely broke my heart and Id really appreciate some guidance on how to handle this For context I have two girls that are currently  and  I will firstly acknowledge that I am a little harder on my six year old but not by much They both have their separate responsibilities and generally do their own duties unless the  year old cant and i ask the older one to help her But cleaning taking care of themselves and most of the other responsibilities are spread out equally to the best of my abilityDuring bedtime I usually have a routine We read then i get hugs and kisses from both of them I usually always start with the youngest since shes furthest from the door then go to the older one and do an identical routine Today while getting kisses from the younger one I noticed the six year old crying and I asked her what was the matter She told me that we love her little sister more but wouldnt give further reason as to why I asked her what do i do differently for her sister than her and she said i gave her kisses first I explained why and also emphasised to her that I always generally give turns when it comes to cuddling duties etc I told her i love them both very much and I dont want her feeling less loved though Im pretty certain I shouldnt have negated her feelings Im feeling kinda crappy with the whole conversation and would really appreciate some advice and guidance on how to handle this going forwardThank you

181,ptdr0y,98lee,mom,27,Advice on grandmother with no boundaries I am just so frustrated by this all the time I just recently started setting actual boundaries for myself with her and I feel so guilty For context my grandma has a severe shopping addiction I was a single mom for the first few years of my daughters life and I dont remember enjoying really any part of her infantnewborn stage because I was so overwhelmed by doing everything myself and by the CLUTTER in my house My grandma uses my daughter as an outlet for her shopping addiction and would drop off bags and bags of clothes and later on random stuff like every single thing from the holiday section of the dollar tree on every single holiday When my daughter was a baby she expected photos of her in every outfit I felt like I had to constantly change my baby and take a million pictures in outfits I didnt necessarily like or choose just to make my grandma feel appreciatedShe also takes it upon herself every year to buy my daughters holiday outfits without consulting me on them or asking if I already had one and fully expects her to wear those outfits for the holidays This year she asked my daughter what she wanted to be for Halloween in August and then just ordered the costume without asking me She bought so many clothes with the expectation of getting photos in them that my daughter basically didnt wear anything that I had purchased because I liked it when she was a baby I felt like I was doing the caretaking part of having an infant and other people were taking the fun part away from meMy grandma loves football and Hello Kitty and even though she knows I have absolutely zero interest in either of those things she still bombards me with hello kitty clothes and FOOTBALL clothes She expects me to put my daughter in a football outfit every time the team she likes plays even though I have no interest in football whatsoever and never have She also expected me to use my limited storage space to keep every single piece of football or HK clothing she buys my daughter just in case my uncle her younger son ever had kids Without even telling me this because Id have made it clear I didnt have room to do so She just acted like it was a no brainer that of all my daughters clothes those are the ones Id have chosen to keepI told her around  months ago that the amount of clothes my daughter has is extremely overwhelming for me and that Id be getting rid of a lot of them and that she needs to stop buying so much She was very offended and said well you can give me the Hello Kitty and football clothes back when youre done and Ill store themI told her of the hundreds of clothing items shed bought most of them had been donated or gifted to other people and that I did not specifically pick those items out to save for a future baby as neither of those things are things I enjoyShe then proceeded to bring another bag of football outfits over and repeatedly said Say go Seahawks Say it Say it Say it Cant you just say it To my  year old until she finally did Then grandma says see maybe you dont like football but she does I didnt even know what to sayA week later she texts me the Seahawks are playing has she tried on her cheerleader outfit yet I said no and she probably wont Like Ive said before we dont watch football and its not something were into Ive been letting her pick her clothes more often and when Im the one who picks that is just not something I would ever reach for as football is not something we enjoy at all She never replied and I could tell she was mad I just feel like its really bizarre to bombard someone with clothes for their kid that are themed to something no one in their household cares about in the slightest and expect them to put their kids in them all the time I cant even say keep it at your house for when you have her during a game because they dont let her come over during a game and barely have her at any point Apart from the clothing and junk problem she also seems to think its her duty to teach my children her religion even though she knows Im not doing that and am not a religious person She says I put her Little People away except the ark I need to teach her about that And buys her prayer books and stuff I told her the other day as well that I feel this is inappropriate and an overstep and that Id appreciate if shed leave the religious aspect of our parenting choices to us her parentsIm pregnant right now and she made a big deal about me saving a Little People Frozen castle for our soon to be baby boy I said I put away her LP since shes too big for them now theyre saved in the garage for the baby She said not the princess castle right Hes a boy I said its just a toy Im not concerned about that at all My son can play with whatever he wants to play with And she said well within reason Hes a boy He needs race cars and  the farm set not a Princess set I told her this is my son and he can play with whatever toy he chooses to play with Please dont ever tell my son he cant play with something because he is a boy And she just shut down She also told me when I was excited about having a boy that shes sad because boys are boring not as many cute clothes and I cant buy Hello Kitty stuff when I already told her I have been very excited about us having another baby and he already has all the clothes he needs and she knows I dont even like Hello Kitty at all regardless of the babys sexI love my grandma and she constantly wants to spend time with us and doesnt get why I avoid it most of the time but the way she steps on my boundaries is so exhausting I can hardly take it I just needed to vent and I guess ask for advice because I feel like Im either getting walked on and letting people make my life a stress cesspool or Im being rude to them by putting up boundaries and then I feel super guilty As a side note also stressed because I told my MIL and my mom they could both be in the room when baby is born which I would be fine with but the hospital is only allowing  people and then one has to leave immediately after the birth and no other visitors can come up My fianc thinks his mom should be the one because my mom got to see my daughter be born which was way before COVID and before I met him but I told him if I have to choose between them it will be my mom for sure because it is a medical procedure involving me and no one else and that I need who I am the most comfortable with thereI just feel bad because that means whoever isnt allowed in the room wont get to meet him for however many days we are at the hospital and I do feel like Im taking something huge away from them

186,pstov9,MBMBaMary,mom,50,Im not okay TW choking My sweet baby and I had a horrific moment yesterday And I just need to get it out because although she is doing amazingly well I am not On mobile and anxious so forgive spellingformattingI picked her up after school shes mo so its essentially daycare which is also where I work She was sitting on the playground with four other babies and two toddlers There was a toddler teacher two infant teachers and one of the administrators One of the infant teachers was a floater teacher who I have worked with before Shes in college and comes after her classes not important but she does seem less engaged than when she was here in the summer months I went over to them and looked at my daughter The floater said something like shes over there eating the woodchips in a flippant way like she was joking or something I familiar with the rules and expectations assumed she had not been allowed to put them in her mouth Ive personally and seen other teachers run across the playground to take things out of childrens mouths Because the woodchips are actually rubbery thick and are supposed to be one solid ground but rip off constantly So I pick her up and I take the pieces out of her hand She looks normal and doesnt appear to be chewing anything I say bye and start going to the car She is a talkative happy baby and she was so quiet But I assumed that she was tired like many days So I continued to the car trying to talk to her and engage her I strapped her into her seat and as I began to tighten the straps I looked at her face She was terrified and she gave the weakest cough Ive ever heard I am trained in CPR for all ages first aid choking all that jazz But for some reason instead of being calm and remembering my training I panicked I will never ever forgive myself For a moment as my brain tried to understand all I could do was yell her name I wish to God that I hadnt It scared her and she started to silently cry Her sweet little face with that look of terror is haunting my every single moment Awake or asleep I was quickly able to take her out and roll her so I could hit her back I swept my finger and I couldnt feel anything I hit her several times and tried to say it was okay to her but I was panicking and I knew I needed help Other kids and teachers were outside so I ran across the parking lot and I got the first teacher and I said shes choking I need help She didnt even hesitate She grabbed my baby and did exactly the right steps to dislodge the pieces in her throat My baby coughed and cried finally The teacher checked her mouth a few more times and just hugged us and reassured us I just was frozen holding my baby so close I took her to the car again after thanking the teacher and I just held and kissed her and apologized I failed her If I hadnt looked at her before putting her in the car seat base she wouldve died on the way home If I walked a little more quickly she might not have been making a face that stopped me I knew something was off but I didnt think she would have been allowed to put things non food in her mouth She very well could be dead I wish I had been able to save her myself I feel so guilty and so useless I failed her But shes okay now We stayed home today together and I just soaked it in Shes incredible and so brave and so resilient Shes been seen by the hospital and shes  okay Eating drinking wet diapers etc I am so thankful I stopped to look at her but so horribly anxious and upset about how close this was I love her so much I stayed up watching her all night I cant shake this anger and anxiety I couldve lost her This stupid teacher almost caused my baby to die Why was she allowed to put them in her mouth I know the rules and I know that this teacher was close enough to stop this from happening but too busy talking to keep my child safe Choking on food would be one thing still horrible but not negligent I am still shaking I just needed to tell people who can relate to my fear Sorry that this is jumbled up Im a messEDIT Thank you all so very much for helping ease my mind I do have a therapist who I see weekly I have diagnosed  bipolar disorder panic disorder and PTSD and take several medications to help my moodanxietynightmares These past two days have been full of anxiety and flashbacks to her little face but I spent the whole day with her yesterday just loving on her and not going in to workdaycare It was both of our last days there I am SO grateful to you all for taking the time to read this and comment your stories and support Im going there this afternoon with my husband to get some answers Again THANK YOU Reading your comments makes me tear up and feel validated Hugs to you all

286,prd05x,mama-spit-up,mom,21,Good grief What no one tells you about motherhood is that so much of it is centered around grief loss and mourning I feel like I am constantly grieving and that it is suffocating ampnbspI grieve for my marriage I no longer recognize or feel times when we feel easy around one another when we joke laugh or play with one another I feel tired in my husbands presence and he says things that continue to draw attention to the fact that we have some fundamentally different values that will continue to impact how we raise our family I grieve a time where our relationship was not weighed down by house chores imbalance resentment and unspoken frustrationampnbspI grieve for myself Its true while Ive gained so much of my identity in developing as a mother Ive lost just as much if not all of myself who I was in the process I grieve and mourn who I was before I grieve opportunity for undiluted and uninterrupted selfexpression I could engage in hobbies painting crafts therapy social support or even just phone calls without thinking about what else it might impact Whatever vision I had in mind for an organized or picturesque farmhousestyle home is gone replaced with scattered toys cluttered counters dirty dishes and messy laundry strewn about every room I have said goodbye to having an organized useful art studio I no longer have illusions about free time to do anything other than clean or manage our home ampnbspI also grieve my child Every day I know that sounds strange but hear me out He changes And the rate of that change is devastating Currently I am grieving his sweetness He is no longer the sweet boy that clung to only me that wanted only mama that would refuse all others He is no longer compliant or sometimes even receptive He is a terror in a yearolds body He pushes me out of the room and yells Go mama He screams at me and wont allow me to comfort him at times He does come around most of the time but it breaks my heartampnbspI grieve the part of me that really wanted to be a mother That part isnt as strong as it once was I feel shame for admitting that Its just that I dont recognize myself or my marriage or parts of my life sometimes I feel sad I feel alone and isolated I feel frozen and unable to reach out and although I know many people could probably relate theres still a voice in the back of my head that says They dont care No one caresampnbspSo Im trying I sincerely fear the idea of posting on the internet Also I have never posted on Reddit but been a lurker under a different account for years so the idea of actually posting fills me with so much anxiety that I dont know what to do with myself This is me trying not to feel so isolated or anxious or alone or ashamedEdited for formatting

288,prlkr4,Elpickle,mom,22,How do you establish a nap schedule Hey everyone first time mom of a  month old here Im trying to figure out how to go about establishing a fixed nap schedule for my baby Every time I search information about naps for babies online theres always a suggested template to put your baby down at a set time like am pm pm The thing is I have gotten accustomed to putting him down not based on the time of day but rather how long hes been awake He usually wants to go down after  hours of awake time And of course since he wakes up at varying times in the morning and since his nap times vary in length m hours he goes down to nap at different times in the day The times arent that inconsistent like his first nap is usually between  depending on when he wakes up And he takes  naps a day But I just dont understand how parents have these schedules where naps are at fixed timeswouldnt your baby get cranky Wouldnt there be times you put them down to soon after their last nap or too earlyIll also add that I dont really mind my approach it works well for my kid I just find it hard if someone is looking after my baby and they want to know what his nap time is and I give them a slightly vague answer of he naps after  hours of awake time Just looking for some feedback and wondering if other parents have a similar approach to naps

309,prjcp7,Capable_Carrot_8541,mom,16,Need Advice Just need some perspectiveI am going to try and see if I can obtain some supportive advice and I say that lightly because Reddit isnt the most supportive and positive place to look for therapy but I feel its worth a shot I am the mom of  small kids the oldest one being years old and disabled It has been a very rough road with him being wheelchair bound and having  other kids that are back to back in age obviously unplanned but I love them with all of my heart amp soul and I would do anything for them I married my husband quickly and we never had enough money to buy our own house before we started having kids Then with the difficulties we faced with our handicapped child and not being able to afford a down payment we always had to rent our house After the landlords got tired of renting and wanted to sell the houses we have always been kicked out And on to the next rental we went We have moved around so many times and I have always hadto settle because we never had the money to afford what we truly wantedThen the pandemic hit and I was a frontline worker in NYC at the hospital that the patient Zero was at who brought the virus from China The entire city got cleaned out by covid I got infected with it and it left me debilitated for the past year and a half I finally got the courage and medical clearance to return to work My field is in high demand and I have been offered signon bonuses out the a  which has finally afforded us the ability to purchase our own home due to being able to afford the down payment Due to my husbands credit situation we can only obtain an FHA loan The loan limit for FHA sucks and it is not possible to find a house even a fixerupper where we currently live Our family all lives here and has huge homes over a million dollars The FHA loan limit here is k I am sure you can figure that out and understand why we cant find a house within that loan amount And no we wont have any extra money to add additionally to the loan amount unfortunatelyI know that I should and I really am grateful for the ability to find ally purchase our own home However I cant stop feeling like I am yet again settling I dont want to have to relocate and move across the country and take my children away from their family just to be able to buy a house I also dont want to buy a house just for the sake of being able to own my own home and not have to rent I truly feel like THAT is settling If I had to move away from my family across the country to be able to afford to buy a house then that is one thing But to have to sacrifice that and then move into a house that I am not truly happy with makes me feel more depressed like I am settling I dont want to come off sounding like I am ungrateful because I am not at all I just have waited soooooo long to be able to afford to actually buy a house and it isnt the way I imagined it to be I want to feel excited I want to feel proud of myself I want to look forward to leaving this rental and no longer upset that we are being kicked out AGAIN because the landlords are selfish and are trying to take advantage of this housing market  years ago when we first moved in they swore that they werent going to sell the house ever It was a vacation home for them and they even built a wheelchair ramp for my son because they wanted to make us feel reassured that we werent going to be asked to leave Well that completely changed when they said they wanted to sell the house because of the real estate market They offered us to buy it and said they want  million dollars for it Enough said about that I want my children to have the best lives that I can afford to give them but I have waited patiently for so many years for the ability to buy our own home that I want to experience this process And not settle All I have ever done is settle I dont want to do that anymore But we do need a place to live Another thing is the fact that I am being given this money from employers because I must commit myself to working there for  years So in order to keep the money and not haveto pay it back I have to commit to staying there Whichever job I choose needs to be THE ONE because I wont be able to pay back the money I am using that money for the down payment So I feel that if I am committing myself to this after struggling for over a year with my own mental and physical health from this pandemic that I should at least be happy and excited to take this on And I justdont The house that we just got the offer accepted on is no where near my dream home Its not even the ok this will work for now home My kids will have a roof over their heads yes But there will be no room for them to play to have their toys to be able to be a kid It is so small and it is thousands of miles away from my family Please provide any additional help and support you can Please be positive and dont critique my feelings I am just trying to do the very best that I can for my children I am so thankful to be alive after what happened to me And the trauma and PTSD that I have experienced from this horrible virus in NYCThank you for your kindness

326,pr98uo,MiserableBrick2902,mom,18,How to discipline the right way Long story warning Warning this is not to debate but just figure out how to break cycles without also being overrun by my kid I grew up in a household that spankedhit as discipline as a kid not as a teenage My husband grew up in a household that didnt spank or hit but used the Im disappointed methods Let me just say that I never doubted my mothers love and that what she did wasnt on the abuse side We were very close until she passed She made it very very clear to me at a young age that she just wanted to teach me respect consequence etc but that she had rules for herself never hit when youre mad dont go too far etc etc To me this is a hard subject because while I dont agree with hitting I cant deny it taught me respect my actions had consequence and not to mess with my mom I was never one of those throw myself on the floor in the grocery store kids Bc of this During her last years she told me she regretted hitting us and feels she was too hard on etc My relationship with my mother was loving we were friends I could tell her anything and she always made sure I knew if I was in trouble call her shed rather know the truth and come get me then me end up in a bind And I did As a teenager I called her numerous times to get me out of sticky situations and in the end she was just happy I was safe She always made me feel safe loved and happy until the day she died And even now I still feel loved by her My husband never got hit yet his mother highly religious and has very strict rules used the Im disappointed strategy Hes also a great person like I was raised to be no stealing lying respectful etc Because of this he felt he had to have this imagine infront of his parents of being perfect to be loved by them unfortunately his mom would do things like say shes disappointed and not talk to him for days if he did something wrong Fast forward to our relationship and I told him Im an open book and people make mistakes and he can be his true self around me Yet when we go around his parents we both have to filter ourselves heavily Hes had to undergo therapy to undo these things and feelings of not being loved for his true self His relationship with his parents is strained and he feels they dont love him for him and its their way or the high way etc Because of this he lacks confidence in himself sometimes By this his parents style causes more damage then my moms ever did Now on to the question thanks for following this far My husband and I are both against hitting for discipline and dont want to hit my kid Im not that type of person and I dont want my kid to fear me We also dont want to go the disappointment route considering how badly that turned out for my husband BUT I do want my kid to respect me I do not want to be in a grocery store with my kid freaking out I do want my kid to respect me and also learn whats acceptable or not I do want my kid and I to have a loving relationship where he can trust me My kiddo is  months old and I can already tell he pushes his boundaries and though we arent to a place where weve needed to discipline we will be soon I can tell hes strong willed Is there no way to have both To have a loving relationship with your kid but he also respects you and knows not to mess around Where he learns consequences for actions that will hopefully teach him that for his adult life  Where you dont hit but you dont disappointment shame either My worst fear is to have a kid who is out of control thanks to my parenting methods like kids who hit their parents do what they want etc Thanks in advanced from a super concerened parent who wants to do it right and has no one else to ask

333,pql6fz,Vigorouspegasus6,mom,58,w  D Terrified Edit wow Im overjoyed by the response everyone has given me Its definitely helped immensely as I had an emotional day from being exhausted in general Thank you all so much  Ive f never doubted at any point in my life I wanted to be a mom same with my boyfriend of  years m All of our friends have been having babies for the past few years so baby fever was real and even though I was on birth control I ended up pregnant but its totally fine  I seriously know nothing and we are a month away from her being here and Im terrified It was excitement the whole time but now were both worried how will I recover post partum when my bf has to go back to work he has  weeks vacation time he can take and I cant walk the dogs yet What if she doesnt sleep What if I cant get her to stop crying My family isnt much of a help because theyre hours away and not very supportive anyway and his family is an hour away I do know how to change a diaper but is that one skill enough to successfully raise a baby  Does everyone feel just as worried right before their first

337,pqyvwn,annawilliams9016,mom,7,Lip tie Anyone have baby with just lip tie We had baby evaluated by hospital staff and pediatrician for tongue tie as our oldest had this and he didnt have one Breastfeeding was painful at first damaged nipples etc and I had to pump and work on latch and we were able to go back to nursing The lactation consultant we saw said he had a lip tie but that wasnt likely anything to worry aboutOn occasion baby would cough  choke while eating he is generally a noisy eater and also is always sleepy at the breast and seems fatigued after eating Even at  weeks it still can take a lot of coaxing to get him to wake up and continue eating Last week he was diagnosed with silent reflux oldest also had this and we started medicine However we also noticed he is now coughing and choking more frequently at both breast and bottle figured it wasnt a let down issue if occurring at the bottle too Anyone have a baby with a corrected lip tie Did it help choking on milk and sleepiness at the breast Planning to follow up with lactation tomorrow and pediatrician Monday too

615,plcfpb,qbeanz,mom,3,Reflection Give Yourself a Break I cant believe its been three months since I had a human pulled out of my body In that time Ive put so much pressure on myself to be the perfect parent I wanted to do what was best and greatest for my little boy He was jaundiced and had a touch of low blood sugar at birth He had a very real tonguetie shallow latch my milk didnt come in for seven days we had to formula supplement he was too sleepy and didnt wake to feed youtube told me I had to do  minutes of tummy time a day for the newborn and I threw a pacifier at my husband and hit my brand new baby on his soft spot with a very loud THUNK and cried about it for an hourI had two hormone fueled hysterical breakdowns that scared the crap out of my loving and supportive husband I slept so little I started feeling like I was in a dream all the time I fell asleep while nursing the baby I seriously couldnt believe some of the people I knew had done this and multiple times successfully I stressed about my mother in law I felt possessive about the baby I took him to the ER because I googled symptoms and convinced myself he was going to die I cried to my mother that it was too hard and I couldnt do it I cried when the baby cried feeling helpless to help him while he was colicky All these things happened and I was so stressed about whether I was providing the optimal care so my son could be the best that he could be and have the best experience possible and his brains would grow the biggest they could grow Its now three months down the road and although I am still very much in the thick of it I am finally able to come up for air and look back on the past three months and reflect on how far weve come as a family and me as a parent It was unimaginably hard but I must be crazy because I miss parts of it I love my boys smile and laugh but looking at videos I laugh and sigh about the newborn baby who would frown at us in serious contemplation I miss his little squeaky newborn noises which have made way for his much louder and funnier yelling and growling and babbling I miss how teeny he was and how he fit into the crook of my arm So even in the middle of the blur of survival I loved the small moments in between Im thankful for getting successfully past all our breastfeeding issues and staying the course Not that moving to formula would have been a problem but I wanted to breastfeed so Im happy I could still do it So if I could go back in time and give myself a piece of advice it would be this Give yourself a breakIts ok not to have a perfect ten minutes of tummy time a day Its ok if some days all you did was hold the baby Its going to be ok breastfeeding and feeding your boy Sleep is going to even out Youll make it through this tough period  Just hold your baby take a deep breath and make it through Its ok to be stressed its ok to cry its all ok and its going to be ok And if its not ok youll still love your baby and your baby just needs you And in a few months when I reread this post I hope I can reflect again and be better for having taken my own advice Good luck and love to the struggling parents out there Just hold your baby and make it through And try to take mental snapshots of those moments you might miss in a few months

647,pkrr29,Primary-Eggplant-612,mom,19,When do I become family My child So this is more of a rantin need of support amp opinions about a current situation Skip down for the current situation Ive been with my partner for over  years and we have a yo together Not married but we own property together For some odd reason his family always takes precedence not over my family no over his longtime partner and child Apparently we dont count as muchThis has been apparent in a few ways First just  days after the birth of your child one of his close elderly family members died it was sudden but not unexpected due to his health concerns He left me home alone stuck on the tip floor with a newborn and dogs needing outside potty breaks I was by myself from am to pm he or my sisters would stop by to make sure I had water and would let out the dogs x a day He also invited a family member over who invaded personal bathroom space while I was still bleeding from birth we had agreed no visitors like that for  weeks but we needed to compromise It took  days before I broke down and he finally stayed home with us and asked the family member to stay elsewhere His family never told him to go back to his newborn and partner they may have been caught up in grief but I still struggle with resentment towards themAt mos pp he got a call that his dad was going to need open heart surgery Without telling me he took off a full week of work and planned to travel up and help his dad Admirable but paired with the fact that he argued over taking extra PTO for the birth of our child and it feels icky to me Didnt help that this overlapped with my birthday and he failed to even try to celebrate with me when he got home I went out with my sisters after a hellish week being  caregiver for a mo  min showers because he was screaming the whole time listening to him cry while I struggled with laundry baskets due to an unhealed injury from birth it was an awful week We both agreed that was not going to happen againHes done this a few other times where he will take PTO for his family to visit but wont make time for me or the child He didnt request off for the kids st birthday and needed to finagle time with his job at the last minute Decided against celebrating our anniversary Forgot mothers day until pm when his mother reminded him of it Refused to take PTO when I was laid out after the nd vaccine barely able to move from the couch let alone care for our kid I consider him somewhat forgetful but also with confused priorities We also talk about this at length since my job is all about talk therapy and communication I dont analyze him or anything but make sure my expectations are known and ensure he has space to say his thoughtsemotionsOnto the current issueHis family is having a reunion paired with a goodbye party for a relative that is struggling with their health This is extended family and hasnt seen a majority of these family members since the last reunion so they are not close Our area is seeing a moderate but from my work in the community quite alarming spike in positive cases hospitalizations and deaths related to the Delta variant My job is back to masks  The population here is  about the pandemic and vaccines we just had parents protesting mask mandates in schools this past week for reference His family falls strongly into the half of people refusing masks and vaccines or wont confirm vaccination status out of principle Weve already had to quarantine for  weeks before Christmas last year because they didnt let my partner know they were feeling ill when he brought our mo over They tested positive but fortunately we were ok In comparison my sisters tested positive with symptoms a couple weeks pp and they stayed away giving me daily updates and making sure we were safeHe wants to go to this reunion so bad Anything I say isnt a good enough reason Our kid isnt vaccinated if we get sick despite being vaccinated our jobs will be severely affected we cannot afford an ER visit or hospital stay no one will wear a mask he struggles to uphold boundaries with his family our child likes to touch anything and everything he is the main childcare during the week so him going alone is still bad Like from my view it is a bad idea and his parents understand and are now arriving early to spend time with us before going to the party Good compromise in a bad situationI find out that his other relatives were badmouthing me and arguing with him over not going to this party Their reasons are that its no different than going to Target I want to scream F you at this We wear masks avoid the maskless dont maintain extended contact for more than  min and dont let people get in our childs face at Target not the same imo The reunion will be outside but inside if it rains all bathrooms are inside and this house is not the size of a Target so no physical distance This restarted a fight and I know I am likely being overcautious but what is it hurting to not attend this reunion I see endless risks and even though Id love to go and meet all these family members I cant forget about my yo Knowing I willingly exposed him to a virus he has limited ability to fight off would eat me up inside if he did actually get sick He is my family my priority but having a partner that doesnt perpetually sulk about this reunion is getting higher on the priority listI love that he cares for his family but ffs when am I and his son finally going to become family and be prioritized when it is clearly needed in the moment I feel crappy for even trying to equate the family members death and the open heart surgery to some of the stuff weve gone through but its truly his behavior around that which concerns me Thank you for reading this rant I know it was longTLDR Partner wants to go to family reunion with vaccinepandemicdenier extended family Put my foot down since we have a yo and now Im contemplating when the hell his sonpartner will get to that coveted family level of priority

658,pkct8q,ohdatpoodle,mom,18,US Workplace treatment of moms is a disaster Maybe this extends beyond the US but thats where I am and Im miserableI love my job and generally the culture here is pretty great but since having my daughter in December its quite apparent that they fall into the category of you chose to have a baby you get no special treatment and it is really exhausting To be clear Im really NOT asking for anything special other than just some basic consideration and compassion Just a few examplesFor one thing Im currently sharing an office with a coworker because we are the two newest hires and they dont have private offices for everyone and even though Ive been here for a few years they offer private offices by seniority Im currently pumping several times a day and when I do I have to ask my coworker if I may have the office which is an inconvenience to her and makes me feel like an asshole There is a lactation room in a different building that I would have to drive to every time I need to pump which would make it very difficult to work efficiently and Id be MIA for longer stretches for pumping sessions I reached out to the employee ID office to get permission to use the lactation room just in case I need it and was told that I need PERMISSION FROM MY SUPERVISOR in writing to them to be able to use the lactation room That is SO ass backwards to me Can my supervisor somehow confirm that Im in need of a private place to milk my tits three times a day WhatNow we had a team member quit and were bringing in a new hire She had a private office and by seniority Im next in line right WRONG Theyre giving the private office to the brand new hire Meanwhile I still have to pump in a SHARED office  which by the way Im also not happy about sharing in the first place because of COVID  while the newest employee gets a big nice private space Boss man says its more convenient to have new guy move in there than to have to move a bunch of us around seems to completely fail to recognize what a slap in the face it is to meTo top it off we do traveling some seasons for my job and typically the newest hires get the most distant travel territories For some reason they arent changing my territory even though there are now two newer people in the office and are giving the new guy less travel Im in the only territory that sometimes requires days or weeks spent in hotels whereas every other territory is within range to be home every night I asked if they can offer any flexibility so I can possibly work from home days when I have to travel at night so I can spend time with my family my job can  be done remotely we were remote for the past year and a half and they said no There will be days this fall where I will not get to see my infant daughter for over  hours straight because of the schedule they have me on with zero flexibility and they dont care at all that shes still also nursing whenever I am home Its literally only a few days and they cant give me any flexibility to get to see my babyI just needed to vent because I really fucking hate this shit Meanwhile my boss has  older kids and whenever they are sick have off school whatever he works from home and no one questions it He can be home with his family whenever he wants Apparently since Im a woman and I chose to be a working mom I have to put my family on the back burner entirely

776,pimjhy,samelioration,mom,20,Ill take the baby if you want Small ventThat statement drives me bonkers even if its meant with the right intentionsHusband and I live in a multi generational home with my parents their idea when we shared the news of our first pregnancy amid the pandemic crazy not to mention weve been supplementing the home income as weve worked the entire pandemic Im on maternity leave until babys  month shots DH works FT and only had  weeks off FMLA so minimal buffering when hes not homeThis is the first grandbaby on my side of the family baby is  weeks and without fail my mom likes to yell from the other room over my crying infant that she will take the baby This strikes a nerve every single timeWhys my baby crying you ask Oh Because he just woke up hes hungry his diaper needs changed Or the number  culprit Im currently trying to get my milk supply up by trying to BFE and hes pissed off that theres not more milk in my boob so hes screaming at me to feed him more boob juice while I quickly make a bottle of formulaWhen Im told Ill take the baby what I actually hear is Youre obviously doing whatever youre doing wrong and I can do it betterIt doesnt help that literally any time my mom offers up her unsolicited advice it begins with some form of her stating her  yearIve raised  children experience first Right down to her getting mad at me when I tell her No to something I dont want done to my child because either the pediatrician said X is unnecessary or my knowledge base is more up to date on the subject matter When I do allow her to take the baby she always makes some undermining comment to the baby about me this isnt grandmas first rodeo Grandma knows exactly what you need And when I call her on it she has the audacity to tell me she was joking and Im over reacting stab me in the eye with a spoonIm not an insufferable know it all by any means but theres a reason why my number  source of parenting material isnt my mom I love my mom I appreciate her being part of the village but yoooo Baby is only  weeks old and I dont want to resent my mom for this crap
777,pirxmy,Current-Library-4579,mom,9,I dont know where to stand on recent events Long story short my oldest daughters step mom threw concentrated bleach into her eyeIts a little bit of a long story but heres the info to our issueThis happened a little over two weeks ago I was out of town getting a tattoo when her dad sent me a short text saying that my daughter got bleach in her eye and that they washed it out The casualness of the text made me think a very tiny minuscule amount got in her eye and they took care of it But when I got home five hours later I asked to see her to check on her we live next door to each other its not weird no need to explain when she woke up from her nap an hour later he walked her up and I came to the door seeing my  year old balling her eyes out She didnt want me to see it Im assuming because she knew I would do something about it But when I seen her I was in shock In shock that they havent done more than some well water to her face for what they said was a collective of  minutes I immediately hugged her then looked at her eye and undoubtedly knew she needed to go the hospital Her dad which Im not fond of but is an otherwise good parent kept explaining to me how hes had stuff in his eye before and that hes fine sheesh He gave me the run around of what happened but I was just trying to get her to the hospitalAt the local ER I heard bad news so fast and so unexpected that I gasped and cried They were going to transport her to Duke hospital very large and reputable university hospital in Durham NC over an hour away As a mother you never want to hear that your hospital needs a better hospital to care for your little one Guys she was already color blind and couldnt tell how many fingers the nurse was holding up The hours we were there waiting for Duke ambulance to transport her was a horrible precursor to what needed to be done The pH in her eye was  One of the nurses told me her eye was melting They drugged her up to make her as comfortable as possible and tried their best to flush it until the ambulance showed up Best believe when it did I followed it the whole way thereShe was in so much pain Shes scared young in a new place and all these strangers are trying to mess with her freaking melting eyeball So I was okay with comfort measures Duke had to offer You just want comfort for your baby after all They stuck a tube in her eye to flush it out for two hours then they gave her ketamine so they could run the exam that she wouldnt let them do understandably THANKFULLY it didnt reach the back of her eye There was extensive damage done but her eye pressure was normal again Once they got the Ph back normal they sent her home with me And did a follow up the next dayI cannot explain to you how relieving the good news was Her eye was already almost completely healed She left the office happy with the good news because I was happy She is such a selfless and strong little one Even though she still couldnt open her eye the pain had gone down a lot because of the prescriptions drops so she could be present again The follow ups so far are not what we want ideally but its a lot better than what we originally though which was that she would lose the eye Its like our wishes came trueSo if youre still with me thank you I explained so much for context Heres where we get to the point of my postHer step mon claims that she was filling up and cleaning the low kiddie pool while my daughter my shoulder height Im  shes ridiculously tall was also in the pool about to help her wipe it down I know already a big nono My daughter was spinning around and thats when she claims the bleach she was pouring into the pool got into her eye Only one eyewhile she was spinning in circles The bleach that was being poured into a pool knee heightBackstory on stepmom shes been in her life since before she was born Weve had major issues for the first  or so years because she smokes cigarettes in the house my daughter lives at with her dad We have joint custody and he sees her  of the time She is ten years older than my daughters father She has no job her license taken has four kids isnt allowed to see two of them the other two she doesnt have custody of and they dont come around She has three baby daddies three chances to do it right Other than that she has been very active and taken care of her while my daughters dad is at workSoooo Even though I really cannot believe that someone would purposely do something so heinous to such a sweet child the story doesnt make sense what so ever From the beginning of the event its a bunch of text book nonos There are days where I believe its purely an accident out of sheer stupidity Then there are days where I just sit and look and my baby who still cant open her eye all the way and see worth of shit even though its  healed and wonder what really happened My daughter says it was an accident but she explains the story exactly as shes heard it I just dont know where to sit and what to do because regardless of if it was an accident or not there was a lot of neglect that took place afterwards on both of their parts Hes always been a good dad and nothing has ever happened like this with her and her step mom before Im just so worried that if I dont do something about her step mom living with him that something may happen again After all I never thought this would happen to begin with I do know that if we go to court again it will be a hell of a lot of bad consequences because her dad is selfish and ruthless I dont know what to do but I feel like I should do SOMETHING Everyone is surprised when they find out Im still letting her go over there We have joint custody I dont have a choice even if I was sure of what to doSo if you took the time to read this insanely long post thank you again I needed to get it out in one clear thought and know someone out there would acknowledge it Ive had nightmares of that night Even though my  year old daughter has reminded me how to be strong it still hurts so much to see and know the damage that was doneIf you have any advice or words please let me hear themNamaste

807,pi78qu,thecurioushedgehog,mom,7,This is a little lengthy but I need MiL and boundary advice desperately I do not consent for the following to be shared anywhere Im overwhelmed and exhausted with my MiL and just need to vent and get some advice My husband and I just had our first child two months ago First grand child on both sides For background my husband and I have known each other since we were in rd grade so our families are close and we all know each other very well and get along Not a typical situation My in laws live on the west coast and we are in the Midwest About a  hour drive When they came out they stayed with my parents who live about  minutes from meTLDR how do I set boundaries after having a baby with my MiL and preserve my mental health when I feel like shes sucking me dry while still letting her build a relationship with her only grandchildSo my in laws drove out and stayed for  weeks when the baby was born I know thats crazy and why did I agree I was not involved in the planning due to a hard pregnancy and my husband just genuinely didnt think it through His mom is very pushy and basically just told him the plan They were here  weeks before birth and  after They did make themselves useful in the time prebaby My FiL replaced our kitchen flooring and helped my parents install new kitchen cabinets to earn their keepTwo days before the baby was born my husband and I gathered both families to set rules and expectations for when the baby was born They were WHAT YOU WOULD THINK would be common sense but we just wanted to be clear dont kiss the baby wash your hands dont come over unannounced keep visits less than a couple hours to allow us family bonding time ask permission before holding baby well we didnt even get halfway through the list before she stood up and yelled well then we might as well just go home now then And stormed off crying and slamming doors So that was how we started this mess Then we had a semi urgent induction for low amniotic fluids which went wonderfully but was still exhausting and difficult My baby was dealing with typical baby things and my husband and I were completely and totally exhausted My MiL used this to her advantage She was a labor and delivery nurse before retirement so she would come over and help but also ignored basic safety things like dont use a blanket with baby and dont fall asleep with baby on you She showed up at our door completely unannounced at least  times Every time I took baby upstairs and was asleep so she didnt see her because I dont reward bad behavior She was at my house for  hours some days while my husband worked and wouldnt leave and was hogging my newborn I only got her back to nurse her then shed pretty much snatch her away I was too tired to fight and just cried to my husband when he got homeThen there was the kissing The other night I had a dream that MiL kissed her on the face and baby got rsv and died Because MiL keeps going on and on about how she cant wait to kiss the baby Things like That cheek is begging for a kiss from Gams She kissed her multiple times when she was out here despite us telling her not to First couple were truly accidental Then she started justifying with just on the head and crap We told her off but it didnt stop My parents havent kissed her despite seeing her way way more To try to wrap this up now my MiL pretty much demands daily pics and updates and videos and weekly facetimes and phone calls My husband and I each have special nicknames for my baby and I broke down sobbing yesterday when MiL texts me hows my moms special nickname doing today I feel like shes intentionally trying to compete with me to my baby Shes dominating our family photo album with comments about her being gams baby and smiling for her gams when its me and saying she cant wait to kiss babys face Her next trip is in  months and I have so much anxiety I feel sick Any advice is much appreciated I feel like Im spending precious baby time trying to manage her and Im so done but also want to keep the peace and not destroy our relationship

854,phb9e7,Pretty_Angry,mom,7,Baby came early and I still dont know what stroller to buy So I have two kids One D is  and hates walking The other S is a newborn that came early Before S was born I was trying to figure out what stroller to get but he came before I ever resolved the issue now Im scrambling trying to figure out what I needBefore S was born I often brought the stroller on outings to either use as a shopping cart to put my heavy backpack in and fill with our stuff or for D to ride in since she gets tired of walking very quickly Right now we have an old Baby jogger City Mini GT and I love itBut now that I have S Id like to have somewhere to place the baby too I plan on baby wearing most of the time but Its nice to have somewhere to put the baby down when you get tiredMy problem is that I dont want a massive double stroller but I know that realistically I cant expect the four year old to walk as far or fast as I do In fact I dont think I want a double stroller at all except that I doubt a standing board will be enough for D I think she needs a spot to sitId also really like to have a stroller that folds easily without much fuss to get on and off of buses etc without having to deconstruct the whole thing each timeSo basically I was really hoping to get suggestions from all you mamas Is there a stroller you love for two kids that isnt too big It can be a single stroller that has a seat big enough for two to squeeze into although at first Id need the baby to either be in a bassinet or a car seat that attaches or it can be a double stroller thats not too big and folds easily Or it can be something with an attachment like a bench seat for D All ideas welcome Thanks in advance
855,ph6dbr,Squeaky_Pickles,mom,2,Anyone elses toddler stop doing new skills if you ask for them too much Ive noticed that since he was a little baby my son  months is incredibly stubborn about when he does things and how muchlittle he copies people His dad jokes Hes not our trained monkey The problem is my son actively dislikes copying people in many scenarios I can manage to get him to copy me during play sometimes but its like the second he figures out its a learning experience he stopsampxBThis has led to a lot of small skills being acquired and dropped because people end up asking one too many times For instance the baby shark motion pointing to noses baby sign language copying sounds when babbling he does talk some he just wont copy others pointing he picked this back up once it became convenient for him I try not to ask for the behavior more than  times a day and make it fun when I can but he is still onto meampxBIt is making it hard to teach him things He is just starting to pick up on Head shoulders knees and toes which obviously requires me to play the song and do it with him Its been a few days and I can already tell he is starting to be suspicious that this is learning and not a gameampxBIts just making it hard to determine what skills my son has when he is actively dropping skills when we start noticing them There are a few exceptions to the rule like he has learned how to get his sippy cup and drink jug out of the fridge and points to the steps he needs me to do next to take off the lids and pour it for him and he doesnt mind me asking him to do things in that scenario It all seems very fickle and random

894,pfrvha,XOXLingLingXOX,mom,9,Thoughts of a lonely broken child Im looking at my daughter with so much love and I wonder if my parents ever loved me like this I imagine they did until they divorced and got so lost hating each other that they started associating me with the other until I was just a pawn of resentment while they started their new families I hope to silmultaneously be both the parents I needed and that she needs
895,pfy13z,confessions_of_a_mom,mom,22,Soon To Be FTM Is This Normal Weve been pregnant a few times before but lost them all This is the furthest weve ever gottenWere getting closer and closer to the due date but this pregnancy just feels different than the ones beforeBefore I was happy excited and looking forward to the future of our little familyThis time around Im more emotional and cry when thinking about serious topics like the examples to follow anxious worried if Ill be a good mother lots of self doubt terrified if Ill make the same mistakes my parents made while I was growing up etc Im having a girl so I think that definitely plays into my worries and fears hoping that I do better than my own mom did Im also wondering how thats even possible when I have absolutely no roadmap guidance or experience to refer to I want to be the mom that I wish I had growing up Just hoping I dont unintentionally or intentionally cause hurt damage or trauma to my own baby like my mom did to me growing up I just feel an overwhelming pressure to be a good mom but theres tons of self doubt What makes me uneasy is the uncertainty of if Ill do a good job or screw up my kid Its like you wont know the outcome of your parenting skills until the kid is grown up and its already too late by that point to try to fix anythingI wont have a mom to ask questions to learn things from get physical help or emotional support from during the tough newborn stage She exists but realizing as an adult what an unfit parent she was makes me want to create boundaries not rely on her and protect my baby from her aka keep our distance Instead Ill be referring to books YouTube videos and online articles to learn what I can Basically learning everything through trial and error hoping to get things right while I clumsily stumble along in motherhood I envy people who have normal and stable mothers to lean on during their transition into motherhood who they can rely on for support and who can teach them the basics about raising a newborn and motherhood Not everyone has a maternal instinct patience and a nurturing kind hearted nature my mom lacks all of these things I really hope that for my childs sake I dont end up being a mom like herIts like these thoughts hit me out of nowhere to be honest kind of caught me off guard Im just evaluating the good and bad of my own childhood the relationships in my life what I want and dont want for my own child what and who I feel like I have to protect my child from like toxic family members etc I had a very privileged life growing up and was really lucky but now that Im about to become a parent myself Im realizing the dysfunction and chaos that my mom made a normal part of our lives Im pretty sure she suffers from an undiagnosed mental illness People look at our family from the outside and think wow what a great family and theyre so lucky but its all smoke and mirrors No amount of money or success can protect you from traumaWhats interesting is that I think Ive had a pretty fortunate life overall and never looked back on my childhood with any kind of sadness although I always knew my mother was a difficult person but with pregnancy its like Im seeing my life through a totally new lens evaluating how certain childhood events have impacted and shaped me as an adult and truly realizing the trauma its created Its like all of my suppressed feelings are bubbling up out of nowhere Totally didnt expect any of this to happen as it hasnt happened during any of my previous pregnanciesIs it a normal experience to have these deep serious thoughts as you become a mother for the first time I guess when I speak to people in real life they dont understand and are quite dismissive I get told things like Enjoy your pregnancy Its just the pregnancy hormones Recently I was shamed big time also seriously criticized and attacked for not being upbeat and happy during my pregnancy This person had no clue about my journey of self reflection realizing childhood trauma and deep thoughts of self doubt Ive been thinking and feeling lately Still it was extremely hurtful so Im wondering if this person was right like somethings wrong with me for feeling this way during pregnancy and I should just get over it or if my feelings are valid and normalto be expected during this huge life change

944,peoi17,Leap_Quantum123,mom,42,Advice needed MIL saying be careful he doesnt get fat  about our  month old baby  We have a  month old son who has recently started eating solids we are in the UK where they recommended starting at  months My MIL is very traditional  old school and sometimes gives well meaning but outdated parenting advice One of the things was her asking constantly when we would start our son on solids she would ask from  months Our son was unwell when he was born all ok now but I was keen to keep to guidelines and start when he showed signs of being ready so we started at  monthsHe is keen on eating and I offer him healthy home cooked foods I have done all the research about what to feed him  no processed food  salt  sugar etc MIL has seen him eat a few times and hell feed himself avocado on a strip of toast and gobble down someYoghurt etc She has now said on  occasions oh he likes his food careful he doesnt get fat This makes me really angry I think its an extremely unhealthy attitude to have towards a  month old baby obviously she has some underlying eating based issues she loves cooking and eating but is a bit weight obsessed The first time I said he is  months he needs food to grow and thrive The second time other people were around and I didnt get the chance to say anything no one else heard The rd time I overheard her saying it to my husband whilst he was feeding our son  Im also upset about it as our son lost weight after he was born due to illness and he is thriving now but in absolutely no way overweight I dont see how a baby this age could be anyway If anything hes a little light for his lengthSo I want to say something I was thinking of waiting until she next says it then tell her that I dont want her discussing weight or fatness infront of my son She is quite sensitive My husband agrees but generally just counters what she says whilst I want to nip it in the bud now What do you all recommend Sorry for the long post Thanks in advance

950,pf1ms4,catboxsmell,mom,11,I know this is long but I dont have anyone anywhere to turn to I alpilgoze in advance for the length of this post Ive been very independent my entire life emotionally speaking My mother gave me up for adoption when I was  My paternal grandparents raised me I kept in touch with both of my parents and siblings throughout my childhood It was always very strange being home at my grandparents house but my siblinga werent given up for adoption but instead lived with our mother and her drug addicted boyfriend My dad lived with his girlfriend and saw my siblings and I on the weekends When I turned  I left my grandparents house and moved in with my Mother little sister and my mothers husband They had drug problems and so did most of my family members on my mothers side I quickly went from absolutely no freedom at my grandparents to basically having absolutely no rules or expectations of me I started occasionally taking prescription medication simply because I had easy access and because of my childhood my family almost loved me out of guilt and the only way they knew how to make each other happy was trading meds and getting highdrunk together I met my husband when I was  moved in with him and had our first child Fast forward  years I now have  amazing children my own home and essentially trying to cope with a lot of childhood issues along with PPD My mother moved in for a few months with my little sister because she was leaving her husband She went back to him and left me and my husband to take care of my  year old drop out sister My mother retuned a year later and stayed at my home a second time and finally left her husband She stayed here with us until she was secure and had a new boyfriend to take care of her She did get off heavy drugs but the prescription meds were always an issue with her and I because we enabled each other I know she is the adult and should have known better but It got to the point of our weekly outings was just pill day She became a trigger for me and I tried to distance myself from her and my sister because they are both extremely toxic They always managed to guilt trip me back into having a relationship with them My mother and I continued trading meds until she felt that things were getting out of hand I stole a few meds from her bottle Not a proud moment and I am completely aware I was in the wrong Things were getting out of hand Instead of letting ourselves have time and space to clear our minds my mother and sister got together and decided they were going to help me My mother told my sister to send an anonymous tip to CPS telling them that they are worried about the welfare of myself and children I of course cooperated with CPS and the case was closed quickly thank God Its been about  months and I havent had any contact with my mother or sister I feel better than Ive ever felt I know that sentence alone should answer any questions I have But losing my mother over and over just isnt something I can handle She has only came into my life when she needs something The five year old girl in me so desperately wanting wanting my mother my entire childhood wondering if sheas mIssing me She put my children in danger of being taken from me and now that the case is closed and Im thriving without them and just downright enjoying watching them grow Something she was never interested in She wants to be in my life and she desperately misses misses my kids Should I allow her back into our lives sidenote my father started doing heroin when I was  We havent spoken since  my husband has stuck by me basically raised me and watched these people hurt me Now that theyve involved the children he wants me to completely wash my hands of my family Its a scary feeling to know you really dont have anyone even though my parents have never been parents How can I get through this I miss my Dad I miss my Mom Ive longed for them to want me around my for so long That dream has been dead but Im feeling it now more than ever before I just want to be the mother I never had Im really struggling with the betrayal that is happening over and over again Please reply with advice I honestly have no one and nowhere to turn

0,phjaar,TheYellowRose,preg,26,Click here to join a due date private sub  September update Last update posted herehttpswwwredditcomrpregnantcommentsnqblhaduedatesubsjuneupdateI dont have anything new to really add this month I will not be posting as many links to existing due date subs because people are sending too many requests for the wrong year So the only links posted here will be from June  to May  If you need to access any other subs go back to the June update post linked aboveAlso I apologize for how slow I am I really do need some of yall to be moderators and help slog through the requests so if you are interested in being a mod add that to your message or send me a chat request letting me knowThis is all copied from the old postHi yall making a new thread so the old one doesnt get archived and locked for commentsSince the last post weve learned that the join request button absolutely does not work for everyone So Im going to attempt to list all the ways you can request to join the due date subs Please exhaust ALL options before leaving a comment or sending me a chat request because manually typing in names is the absolute worst way to add a lot of you to a private subreddit Try to send an elusive join request Visit the subreddit on a browser not in an app and you might be able to see a request to join type button Itll generate a join request message for you and you send it This is the best way for me to add you as the join buttons in my modmail only take one click to add and I can add a lot very quickly Make sure you are using newredditcom The second best way is to send the subreddit of your choice a message making sure your subject line starts with join and a space after whatever else you want to type This is the string of text that makes the join button appear in modmail in most cases The third best way is to send the subreddit a regular old message saying anything I will be able to click your message click approve and then youre in Not as fast as the options above but works Ill be reposting the prefilled send the mods a message links in the sticky comment under this post  The second worst way is to send me a chat message I get harassed by trolls endlessly so I do not check my chats often BUT the reddit app does have an invite to community feature that I can access once I click on someones profile I then have to scroll through a ton of subreddits with the first like  letters of the sub name displayed hope I click the right one and then I can invite you Super cumbersome and hard to do The absolute worst way is to request to be added in the comments here On the last thread you can see a lot of people didnt even read the post at all and just commented with their requests I really need yall do try all of the above options before you choose  because you will be waiting quite a while to be added I mostly moderate from my phone and this option needs to be done on a computerSo after reading all this you might wonder how in the hell you can send a message to a subreddit If youre using the official reddit app theyve made it pretty much impossible because they have a permanent u stuck to the message box limiting your messages to users only Youll have to download an unofficial app like Apollo for ioshttpsappsapplecomusappapolloforredditid or RIF is Fun for androidhttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomandrewshuandroidredditamphlenUSampglUS and learn to send a message with those You can also use a web browser but I realize that a lot of people do not have full computers or laptops to use When you send a subreddit a message you send it to rsubredditnamehere instead of a username Thats it thats how you message a subreddit Ok now that this is out of the way here is a list of the subreddits that you can request access to babies rJunepreggers  rJulyPreggers  rAugustPreggers  rSeptemberPreggers  rOctoberPreggers  rNovemberPreggers  rDecemberPreggers babies rJanuaryPreggers  rFebruaryPreggers rMarchPreggers rAprilPreggers rMayPreggersI will be updating this post near the first of every month to add the next months linkIn addition to all of this I really want to make sure you all get into the subs as quickly as possible so if youre interested in helping your peers out and being a mod for your due date sub send me a modmail Ill show you all the ropes and teach you how to add peopleAutopopulated message links begin hereI hope this helps those who are having trouble trying to figure out how to message the modsTo make it super easy for everyone Ive made links that will autopopulate a message to the mod inbox of each sub Click these and just hit send This does not seem to work for the official reddit app on ios so try a different app or try it on your computer  June httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetoFrFJunePreggersampsubjectPlease add me as an approved userampmessagePlease add me as an approved user July

24,pwjzyb,jeabgrenouille,preg,1,Graduation  Very positive induction  hours total with foley catheter manual water breaking and pitocin Half of labour with an epidural and half without I was induced this weekend at  weeks due to possible hypertension I was probably fine because all my blood pressure readings at home and at the hospital were normal but they were high for a few weeks in a row at my obgyn appointments and because I was overdue my doctor suggested induction I got to choose when to go in on Friday and I chose pm so that we could get started and then try to sleep At around pm after admission I was given lots of information and then a choice between starting with a foley catheter or cervadil I chose the foley catheter because my doctor had mentioned that one to me already when we talked about induction Foley catheter they inserted it around pm and I was  cm dilated Id been cm for at least  weeks I didnt find insertion terribly uncomfortable I stayed very calm and relaxed and sang a song in my head I always try to focus on dropping my shoulders wiggling my toes and wiggling my fingers to keep relaxed I went into labour in minutes I got contractions that lasted a minute and were five minutes apart I get the sense that that is not common because when I told the nurse she did not seem to think I was having contractions from the balloon but gave me morphine anyway for the pain The morphine did absolutely nothing for me and I labored all night After  hours I thought the balloon had still not fallen out but upon examination not only had it fallen out but I was  cm dilated I just wasnt pulling hard enough when I was checking to see if it had fallen out The doctor told me that yes I had been having contractions all night and at that point she offered me an epidural Epidural I accepted the epidural and loved it I felt zero pain from my contractions It was hard to pee with it but my husband would come with me and I figured it out with some patience My epidural did end up wearing off later on unfortunatelyManual water breaking since I had dilated so much they decided to skip pitocin and just break my water and they figured Id have my baby by the afternoon I felt nothing due to the epidural but we waited about  hours after breaking the water and I only dilated  cm in that time Pitocin and csection scare Because I wasnt progressing much I started on pitocin There was about an hour there where me and my baby were being monitored very closely because it looked like he was not responding well to contractions and they told me it was because my pelvis is so narrow They inserted a monitor rather than using external monitors which were being very finicky and that monitor showed that baby was doing fine If the internal monitor had confirmed any distress we were going to do a csection Assured baby was well we started on pitocin I progressed very quickly from there Apparently much faster than average Unfortunately my epidural started to wear off and the contractions got more and more painful I had to wait a while before I could get a top up but I did get one eventually Labour at around pm I felt a lot of pressure and I asked to be checked I was  cm dilated and fully effaced We waited a bit longer for baby to come down the birth canal and then I got to start pushing For me pushing started out great The first  minutes I just pushed guided by my nurse and then after about  minutes a team of doctors and students came in At that point it became extremely painful and uncomfortable I could feel my contractions the whole time so I think my epidural had worn off again Not sure In any case I laboured for around an hour Every push I gave it my absolute all It seemed like he was so close for so long The last  minutes were just awful They were extremely painful and uncomfortable and I kept saying I cant do it and everyone ignored me and told me to push harder There were a lot of people in the room my husband three doctors two students and my nurse I didnt care about anything except pushing though After about an hour my baby was born What a relief He is wonderful I had to get stitched up No one told me specifically how bad it was but they were stitching for a while and I heard someone say second degree After over  hours though Im not bleeding much and I dont have much pain

42,pvyc69,qwertiful0909,preg,8,Positive birth story at  and  I love reading others positive birth stories here so I thought Id share mine too Its longI had planned a home birth and then was extremely disappointed when I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes My midwife was unsure about a home birth after I went on meds and so I then changed my plans to have her as a doula at the hospital and have my baby there Midwife did agree that if I did go into labor and things were going well and my blood sugar was all good we could just stay at home  and I really hoped that would be the case On Wednesday  I saw midwife for a membrane sweep Doctor didnt want me to go over  weeks because of GD and so also scheduled an induction for the following Monday I kept repeating that I would just go into spontaneous labor and wouldnt even need the induction And she agreed She thought it would be totally reasonable to expect going into labor before the induction would happen I was cm and  effaced She said head was very very low and just keep doing what I was doing lots of squats sex spicy foodsthe works On my way home from the appointment I felt some contractions Nothing regular but there was definitely something At PM I drank Midwives Brew and then I started feeling some stuff I used my breast pump and ate spicy sriracha snacks and did some squats I was determined to have labor start on its own And before Mondays induction I did not want to be induced At PM I was putting my toddler to sleep and started to feel contractions coming more regularly It wasnt at all painful and I couldnt tell when they started and stopped because they were so mild I went to bed with my husband around  I couldnt sleep They were coming regularly feeling more there I kept rotating between my bed the bathroom and the living room carpet  where Id be on all fours or using a ball At AM I went to pee and there was some pink mucous plug I was so excited After that contractions were every  minutes and I started using an app to track things My midwife had told me to contact her when I needed support and things were too much to handle But I was managing fine I used deep breathing rocking on all fours My husband was still sleeping and I didnt want to wake him At  AM I texted my midwife that contractions were  minutes apart for about an hour lasting a minute but I was doing fine and didnt need them to come I didnt get a response and so assumed she was sleeping Which was fine with me I was okay on my ownAt AM my husband woke up and came downstairs I was on the carpet using my contraction timer and rocking and breathing through surges In between I rested and he made some jokes and we laughed and had a nice time together About  my toddler started crying and he went upstairs to her A few minutes later I felt a pop and liquid gushed out of me I made a mad dash on my hands and knees to the dining room  our carpet was only two days old and I didnt want it getting wet It was like the movies  tons of water on the floor I took off my pants and called the midwife I told a very sleepy midwife that my water just broke but I was still doing fine Maybe she can come in twenty minutes And then two minutes later BOOM things got INTENSE I called for my husband to come down NOW And BRING ALL THE TOWELS FROM THE LINEN CLOSET In between some really strong surges I told him to call the midwife NOW Tell her to leave NOW I felt something coming down I knew I was gonna have this baby at home right here Cuz I was not going upstairs to my room This was happeningI was on the dining room floor towels all around On my hands and knees I turned to my husband and said I think Im pushing This is pushing I wanted the midwife to be here already I called again desperate She was eight minutes away and stayed on the phone with me I told her I felt a head coming down I was pushing She told me to breathe and try to not push until they got there My husband went to the door and flashed our lights so they wouldnt miss the house and then they came This was AMRight away I started just going with the flow and pushing Midwives got down on the floor with me and were ready to catch the baby I asked if baby had dark hair  SHE DID I remember yelling I love dark hair It surprisingly was not painful After my last birth I knew to slow down here and breathe to prevent tearing It felt like a huge tomato was between my legs but I didnt have ring of fire or anything like that It was calm and nice During pushing I turned to my husband and said This isnt bad This isnt bad I was surrounded by two midwives I trusted completely and my husband I couldnt have asked for more Slowly the baby descended She was born   just  minutes after the midwives arrived I sat criss cross on the towels and held her Oh my God She was tiny and perfect and had dark hair I was so happy All I needed to do was get placenta out This was supposed to be the easy part but I was not in the mood lol I asked if we could wait a little and midwife was more than okay to wait until I was ready When I was I gave the baby to my husband who sat on the floor right in front of me the whole time She was still attached to the cord so I got on my hands and knees again and tried pushing Pushing then was much harder without the contractions to help me out I couldnt do it Midwife suggested I put one knee up and then placenta came flying out It was huge just like my previous one Like gigantic But thank goodness it didnt have any bones After all that my husband cut the cord and midwife helped me slowly walk to the couch where I sat and just held the baby It was perfect I couldnt believe how quickly the whole thing happened and that my baby was here It was beautiful I wanted to do it again

absolute crap and kept telling my husband I felt sick They day before I kept saying I feel like Im going into labor soon Anyway my appointment was at  PM We got to the dr and she checked my blood pressure and it was a little bit high and it had been getting a little higher with each appointment She went ahead and checked my cervix which was dilated to a  and did my ultrasound Then they checked my blood pressure and it was still high She sent me to do blood work and then sent me to a private room to monitor my blood pressure They told me if my blood pressure was still high Id have to go to the hospital for over night evaluation I kept telling my doctor I didnt feel well and honestly whining a lot As they were monitoring my blood pressure I started having contractions My doctor left to go deliver a baby so I was with the nurse and the nurse told me She told me that to do if your blood pressure went up or down but didnt tell me what to do if you started having contractions Eventually my dr came back and they sent me downstairs to labor and delivery They put me in a small triage room and had me sit for about an hour or so It was about  pm at this point My doctor came back in and checked my cervix and it was now at a  so they had me switch rooms to an actual labor and delivery room Luckily my dr allowed me to eat as I hadnt eaten since  am that morning In labor and delivery they hooked me up to a monitor drew more blood and started an IV My contractions were very consistent and my dr told me I was officially in labor and going to have my baby the next day Around  PM another dr came in to break my water which I hated every minute of Around  PM I decided I was ready for my epidural as my contractions were getting pretty painful The anesthesiologist took an hour and a half to do my epidural and it was horrible He kept asking me if I had scoliosis which I do not I had to move positions several times He was about ready to call another anesthesiologist in but eventually he managed to find the right spot and left me with a lot of little pin holes in my back After that I was able to get a little bit of sleep but then I kept waking up to throw up A nurse came in and gave me some Zofran They kept upping and lowering my dosage of petocin throughout the night Then the next morning my dr came in to see me as soon as she got in I was a  My dr made a joke about how I was probably going to be able to order lunch because she thought Id be giving birth early that morning and had me practice pushing Around  am I called my grandma and aunt to head to the hospital because I thought I was going to have the baby soon Little did I know Id be pushing for  hours I was exhausted falling asleep and throwing up on an empty stomach I have acid reflux and they had me in positions that made me throw up on myself They would tell me to push then take a break Then I ended up running a fever so they started talking about a csection At this point I wasnt listening when they told me to take a break because the urge to push was way too much I had a hot spot in my lower left abdominal area that hurt like hell and just wanted to be done His head kept bobbing back and forth and he just did not want to come out My dr came in and I pushed with her for over an hour and then they called for another dr to come in and use a vacuum It took about another half hour of pushing and they threw an oxygen mask on me and I felt like I couldnt breathe and kept throwing it off and my husband and the nurse kept putting it back on me Eventually my baby boy came out I was crying uncontrollably at this point They put him on my chest and let us take a few pictures then they took him away to the NICU My husband followed him down the the NICU My dr pulled out my placenta and then stitched me up They at some point had done an episiotomy and I had a level  tear My baby was born at  PM on September st I ended up having to stay an extra  hours to get antibiotics due to running a fever as well as my baby I had to wait  hours before I was allowed to get out of bed or anything Also I should mention they took out my catheter twice for whatever reason and the nd time they went to put it back in my stuff was so swollen that it took two people to get it in In that time the nurse practioner from the NICU came in and told us that our baby had bleeding in his head due to the vacuum extraction She couldnt give me any more information when I asked if he was going to be okay or not Which worried me Eventually around  am I was able to get up and go to the bathroom and then go see my baby They wouldnt let us hold him which was frustrating The next night they let us hold him finally A pediatrician came in the next morning and said that our baby was jaundiced and would have to be under the UV lights They had our baby on oxygen feeding tube and antibiotics When I was released from the hospital and had to leave without my baby it was really really hard on me I couldnt stop crying even though Id be able to come in and see him at anytime I struggled a lot They kept him for a week and the last couple of days he was there was really frustrating because they didnt give us any reason as to why they were still keeping him He was off oxygen IVs the UV light and the feeding tube The nurse that looked over him wasnt the most understanding which made it even harder Other nurses would call the dr for us to give us an actual update but the one who was there during the day would just be like I cant answer that for you We ended up going in super early in the morning to catch the nurse practioner She expedited things for us and got him an MRI that day instead of the next morning Then she told us we could take him home the following morning The MRI indicated that the bleeding had stopped but there was one pinpoint spot on his brain that had been affected by the bleeding and that it was only a  percent chance that it would cause any development issues but we wouldnt know until our child was  years old Our baby boy is home now and absolutely thriving He was considered premature as he was born  days before  weeks The pediatrician we took a couple days after he was released said that he looked so well he didnt even need to run tests for jaundice and that he was going to treat him as normal newborn Hes been home for  weeks now and he is absolutely thriving Note I am also really lucky to have my husband He was absolutely fantastic the entire time and very supportive Note please excuse grammar and spelling errors TLDR Went in for a prenatal and ended up having my baby  hours later

first pregnancy Its taken me  months to get around to it so I hope I dont forget too many detailsI started contractions around am when I was  I was someone who wondered during the third trimester is this pain a contraction Is this Braxton Hicks Will I know As soon as I got them I knew They felt completely different like a balloon was inflating inside me yet also squeezing my uterus in I didnt wake my SO because it was too early but went into panic mode trying to finish up my to dos When the contractions got to about  minutes apart around am we drove  minutes to the hospital By the time I got there though the contractions had slowed down And when they checked my cervix which hurt like HELL I was only cm dilated and  effaced I was worried that we would have to drive back and forth but they admitted me around am because I had elevated blood pressureI tried to labor in different positions but the monitors kept falling out and my poor nurse had to readjust them a lot She seemed pretty stressed so it was kind of stressful for me to try different positionsMy contractions werent progressing much so they began Pitocin around pm I think they admitted me specifically to induce me but no one talked to me about it until much later The nurse came in with a bag earlier in the afternoon and was about to hook it into my IV when I was like WAIT WHAT IS THAT And the nurse was like oh no one talked to you about this Let me talk to the doctorAnyway after the Pitocin started my nurse reassured me that the contractions wouldnt get bad right away so I could wait a little to get an epidural I had always planned to get one but wanted to wait as long as I could so I could delay being bedriddenI got the epidural around pm My SO actually said to me Im surprised that you got it so early I still had the wherewithal to calmly tell him that wasnt the best thing to say The insertion was uncomfortable but it wasnt too hard to stay still My lower body was pretty numb and my legs were heavy I could still feel the pressure of the contractions though And a good thing about the epidural was that cervix checks didnt hurtMy labor was still stalled so we made the decision to break my water at pm Things finally started moving after that By PM I was cm and  effaced At some point pain came back to one side because the medicine was pooling in one side I tried to lay on my side to spread out the medicine but it didnt work I tried to communicate this to my nurse but it took what felt like hours but was probably less for her to understand that I needed a different solution I think I was in or nearing transition at this point so it was painful as fuck I remember thinking THIS IS HOW IT FEELS WHEN I CAN ONLY FEEL ONE SIDE WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE FOR BOTH SIDES IM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN And then also thinking I guess Im in the stage where people say Im never doing this again but they forget about it and sometimes do have another baby BUT NOT ME IM REALLY NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN Eventually an anesthesiologist came back to administer more medication and I didnt feel painAt some point after midnight my babys heart rate dropped a lot during contractions We tried changing my position but it kept happening I was really scared that I would have to get a Csection Im really squeamish and also wanted to avoid having to recover from a surgery Then the doctor suggested something I hadnt heard of before which was to fill my uterus with saline Apparently heart rate drops can happen because theres less cushioning for the umbilical cord after your water breaks or something like that The saline worked So for anyone in this situation and wanting to try something before needing to do a CSection look into itAt am I was fully dilated and my baby was ready to come out I felt this pressure and urge to poop so the nurse got the doctor I only had to push a few times including the practice pushes before he came out The doctor barely had time to get set up I ended up with a nd degree tear but it was mostly internal I had some hemorrhaging that concerned the doctors but additional medication took care of itIt was wonderful to finally meet this little creature who was bouncing and kicking and stretching like he was training for a fight in the womb And hes turned out to be an active strongwilled baby at  months Some other notes I was soooo excited to finally eat something that wasnt jello or pudding I was glad I packed some comfort snacks for after the deliveryThe first time I slept in the recovery room I felt contractions and the poop pressure again I woke up thinking NOOO NOT AGAIN But I was not in labor again It was just in my headA few days after discharge I went back to triage because of high blood pressure I didnt have to be admitted but Im glad they induced me since my blood pressure was really becoming an issueThanks for reading good luck on your journey and goodbye for now

289,puwb9m,marijuanamama_,preg,3,Not as PlannedWanted But So Worth It  Throughout my pregnancy I was excited to go into labor with my water breaking and contractions I wanted a vaginal delivery and no epidural I really wanted to be able to walk around and move about as needed throughout my labor and right after delivery Towards the end of my pregnancy last  or so weeks I had high blood pressure they actually sent me to LampD to be evaluated at one point but I was sent home thankfully So my last dr appointment was at around  and they told me due to my blood pressure Id be induced  at  am Im sad beyond anxious and stressed but its whats best for baby and me so here we go to LampD at  am While there they are of course constantly checking my bp every  minutes They had me wear a BP cuff that I couldnt take off not even while I slept They inserted some medicine into my cervix that would make me dilate given I was only at  cm Maybe  So as us and the nurses were waiting for the medicine to do its thing I fell asleep My blood pressures were high so they were concerned but still just monitoring it At one point I went to sleep and while I was asleep I has a BP reading so  and this is when things started getting a bit more intense Due to my BP readings my doctor ordered that I start blood pressure meds and a magnesium drip The magnesium drip meant that I would not be able to walk around or stand So this meant I was bedridden until  hours After delivery Whenever delivery would be This also meant that since I had to be bedridden I had a catheter inserted I was double bedridden until  hours after delivery They start my cervical checks and honestly they just got more and more painful with each one It was like they were trying to find a way to my throat through my vagina On to day two This was Tuesday Sept th Soon my water broke and the magnesium began to take its toll not only on me but our son His heart rate was dropping in utero They would try to reposition me about once a minute it felt like asking me to lay on my left my right tilted legs up using a peanut shaped balloon Any and all kinds of positions to help his heart rate The positions didnt work They offered an epidural and I thought long and hard about it and I took it I couldnt handle any more cervical checks or anything else after  hours of not sleeping or moving around After the epidural his heart rate was low so they inform me they will have to perform a c section Again its whats best for my son so here we go to the ORThey obviously give me the stronger epidural for the surgery Now a little side note literally the most pain Ive experienced is maybe like a leg crap in my calve or a cheek piercing maybe So Ive never had stitches Ive never been in the hospital thankfully with any sort of illness I rarely go to any doctor let alone a hospital So this is all incredibly new for me They tapestrap me down in like this cross like sacrifice style position all I see is ceiling lights and a cover that they put at my chest so I wouldnt see them cutting me open Im hearing voices Ive never heard before my anesthesiologist standing over me literally talking to me I feel like I cant breathe and he says Im fine I cant find my SO and finally they let him in there I recognized his beautiful brown eyes immediately behind his mask and surgical suit they had him wear I felt tons better with my SO there but still like I couldnt breathe Hes born and I hear him cry for about  seconds and then stop and hear him again so its off and on with his crying My SO is with him they come to show him to me while theyre stuffing everything back inside me to stitch me back up I saw my son for maybe a few moments until they took him away to NICU They finished the c section and wheeled me back to my room where we got started on pumping the nurse gave me a rag bath and wheeled me to a postpartum wing I still havent seen my son again and I cant get up to go see him because in on the magnesium drip and catheter Once I got to postpartum Im not sure when it was or if I was bugging them or wouldnt shut up about it or if they wanted me to see him but these beautiful nurses rearrange a big part of nicu to fit my huge ass bed in this small room so I could have skin to skin with him as soon as possible  After that I went back to my room and was still hooked up to IVs and a BP cuff I still couldnt get up or walk for another  hours After the  hours all of the postpartum nurses said they didnt see me anymore because I was mobile lol and always in NICU He spent a long week and few days in NICU and now we have him home  We have both never been so in love and I love hearing him cry  So unfortunately I didnt get to experience my water breaking or any contractions apparently I was contracting the entire time but never felt anything I didnt get to experience a vaginal delivery or walk around We didnt have our baby with me right away and had to go home and sleep next to an empty bassinet some nights But as cliche as it sounds it was completely worth it Id do it a million times over for these precious eyes and cries and sneezes and hiccups

510,ptlrah,happymuffinslug,preg,10,My mom is convinced I will hard my baby if I breastfeed him since I have been vaccinated for Covid Please do not share Ive had a lot of issues with my mom growing up and now that I will be having my baby soon  week countdown I see so clearly how narcissistic she is Its been a lot to accept mentally and this Covid vaccine and pandemic has shown me who she is as a person My mom is antivax Not just with Covid but she even went as far as getting my brother and I opted out of shots when we were in middle school She also chose to treat us with natural remedies colloidal silver and essential oils any time we got sick So keep in mind I grew up with these things from a young age and thought it was normal not to go to the doctor for medicine or to be checked out She claims that doctors didnt know what she knew about natural remedies so to her their information is useless I think back to that now and it couldve been so much worse for us in terms of our health and recoveryFast forward to now  My husband and I decided it would be in our babys best interest that no one unvaccinated is around him I explained to both my parents our reasons why and they accepted it I cant force them to get anything and never would but it still left me feeling hurt that my mom would let her fear of medicine cloud her judgement I feel my dad is only avoiding the shot because he is afraid of what my moms reaction may be but thats a whole other storyIn the beginning of my pregnancy I told my mom I had to get the rhogam shot due to having O blood The first thing she asked is if it was necessary I said yes it is if I dont get this shot my baby can have severe health problems or worse Her response Dont be taking just everything the doctors give to you After that I stopped sharing anything related to appointments with her A couple weeks ago I asked my mom to consider getting the Tdap vaccine She smirked and told me her immune system was strong enough that she wouldnt catch whooping cough or pass it to my baby She also mentioned that since the shot isnt  effective then it was pointless to get it plus she is worried about what side effects it may cause to her Sooo what about the fact that my baby could end up in the hospital if I let her around him unvaccinated The best part She recommended to use colloidal silver if he ever gets sick because she read that it was safe for babiespregnant women in one of her health booksTo add to all this my mom is convinced I am going to poison my child if I breastfeed him Shes gone so far as to tell my aunt and MIL because shes convinced Ill listen to them since I wont entertain any vaccine talk with her My MIL told me about this today while we were having lunch and said my mom sent her  articles talking about moms who lost their babies after receiving the covid vaccine and breastfeeding them Im guessing she found these articles on FB because I couldnt find anything myself on Google I also didnt look too hard She told me she was crying and choking up over the phone and said she is terrified for my babies life She also told my MIL to try to talk me out of breastfeeding my son I felt at a loss of words hearing that After thinking about this conversation it made me feel like my mom is truly a lost cause Theres no way a normal relationship will ever be possible with her Anything I do to raise my baby will be questioned And what makes me so angry is that to me this means my mom doesnt think Im capable enough to make decisions for myself or my child unless I consult with her firstMy cousin is a PICUNICU traveling nurse and has tried to explain the importance of this vaccine to her own mom my moms sister and she has stopped speaking to her just for getting the jab When my cousin told my mom about this she told her in these words  you seem like you have an unhealthy amount of anxiety about this pandemic Have you considered getting help for this like wtf My cousin deals with covid patients and knows first hand how dangerous this virus is but my mom acts like shes being a drama queen and completely invalidates her feelings Like how could my mom be so heartless to her niece that is terrified she may lose her parents due to them being careless I told my MIL that I cant feel bad for my mom She has invalidated my feelings and my cousin who is in the medical field about this subject and now shes reading QAnon articles and wont listen to anyone telling her that they arent trustworthy sources When my aunt pointed out the sources for these articles my mom got mad and didnt talk to her for  days after that All that matters is that these articles are reinforcing what she believes so to her shes right and everyone else is being lied to It makes me mad she spoke to my cousin this way and is now crying to other people that I refuse to listen to her I just dont understand  unborn babies in my county have died because their mothers were unvaccinated and ended up being hospitalized due to covid Not to mention the ones who have been effected in bigger cities in my state of Texas Does that need to happen to me for her to realize this pandemic is real That this virus doesnt give a shit who you are or what you believe My parents also just had a family friend die last week from covid He was  and healthy with a family and now hes gone because he didnt think he needed the vaccine My dad lost an uncle to covid My husband has lost  greatgrandparents to this disease as well Despite this she still tries so hard to tell me these conspiracies that she believes as trueI feel like this post is a little all over the place and Im sorry if it is I just cant believe I have a mom like this This should be a happy and exciting time in our lives and she cant even give me that

873,prsgxa,Iwillsingyoulullabys,preg,7,Positive Birth Story  months ago I have birth only just getting round to posting about it nowFTM Born during covid  Known baby girl Delivery  weeks exactly Relief  TENS Gas and Air TW  rd degree tear  I have put TW again where it comes in the story   Contractions are known as surges Birth plan is known as Birth PreferencesHypnobirthing was recommended to me by a friend and I instantly fell in love  My whole pregnancy I was  talking about it  Its been fascinating to learn about  A few days before my due date I felt like my body was gearing up for labour  I told my midwife how I felt at our appointment the day after my due date and she predicted we wouldnt need our appointment for the following week  However sods law meant that after this things slowed down  My whole pregnancy people had confidently announced to me that Ill be late  Some started asking when I expected to be induced  It was quite disheartening and I had a big cry one night  So OH and I came up with a plan to get that oxytocin goingThe following night we finished up our Harry Potter binge with the final film cuddled together on the sofa with chocolate  Shortly after the film ended at pm my surges began  We both went to bed  At am I woke up  The surges felt quite exciting  At am I decided to run myself a bath and got my tea lights out  Armed with the meditations on the Freya App I relaxed in the water  My fiance was quite nervous and wanted to go to the birth centre but I reassured him that this would take some timeam  Still in the bath I began to time the surges  It was more to ease my fiances concerns I was still very relaxed and prepared for it to take a long time  I found they were every  minutes and lasting roughly  seconds each  am  I got out of the bath and began to potter around making my labour nest  Towels on the sofa snacks at the ready tealights dotted around and positive affirmations on the wall  Still very chilled out  At  my waters broke thankfully I had just laid the towel on our brand new sofa  However I saw that my waters were brown and knew that baby had most likely done a poo  I also knew that this meant my water birth had likely gone out of the window But thanks to Hypnobirthing I had always referred to my birth plan as birth preferences so the realisation didnt panic me  Had baby not done a poo we would have stayed at home for a few hours but knowing it can indicate distress we went in  am  We arrived at the birthing centre which was closed due to lack of staff  Thanks covid  So back upstairs to the hospital  Midwife took one look at me and said I looked far too happy to be in labour and to expect to be sent home  While they took me to a room to wait for checks my fiance was sent back to wait in the car  That was frustrating as we had been informed previously he was allowed to be there the whole time  I used the Freya App to continue to measure my surges so I could show the midwife  Meanwhile my fiance texted to ask if I could act less happy and more in pain so he could come back in the room During this time my waters kept going  It was mad  I thought it either trickled or had one big gush  I had multiple big gushes  My lovely joggers Id bought for labour were soaked and had to be abandoned  am  I showed the midwife the timings of the surges and they agreed that I was actually in labour  They also agreed that baby had done a poo so I was transferred to the labour ward where my relieved fiance was waiting  Not the waterbirth in the birth centre I had hoped for but was still calm  I accepted the use of the TENS machine at about   pm  A new midwife came along and asked if she could examine me  Due to my vaginismus and vulvodonia Id said in my birth preferences I wanted to avoid these  I didnt want to have a surge of adrenaline which would negatively impact my labour  The midwife was brilliant  Shed read through my notes and presented me with an action plan of how to make things easier for me with numbing gel and gas and air  I used my BRAIN Benefits Risk Alternatives Instinct Nothing and agreed  At this point I was cm  pm  Due to baby doing a poo I was being monitored round my belly  They requested another VE and as I had coped well during the last one I accepted  This time I was cm  The previous time Id handed the gas and air back but this time I kept it  I had wanted to move around but the monitor round by belly kept losing her heartbeat so in the end I needed to stay on the bed  The monitor attached to her head refused to pick up anything at all so was abandoned  pm  The surges really intensified quite suddenly  I wont lie a lot of Hypnobirthing went out of the window  However my fiance was amazing coaching me through breathing and kept me on track  At one point a Stage  Alert alarm went off outside the room and my adrenaline soared through the roof  It was then quite difficult to come back down  At half  I began to feel the need to push  During my labour I felt like an animal in a cave and even more so when I started announcing Push on each out breath  The midwife was quite surprised at my insistence because I was only cm less than an hour ago and went to fetch a senior midwife  The midwife explained that because baby was back to back Id likely feel the need to push a lot earlier than I needed to  The need to push was so intense that I whispered to my fiance Epidural because I couldnt ignore the feeling  As they went to fetch the anesthetist my fiance asked them to check me again  I heard the midwife say Oh  Shes coming  My fiance asked if I could get that epidural and they said that it was a bit late now  Our daughter was on her way  I was feeling quite distressed at the pain and definitely felt like an animalistic side was taking over  My fiance reminded me what wed learned about the transition stage  In the back of my head I remembered the breathing and my fiance continued to be an amazing support  pm  Baby made her entry into the world    Id always imagined tears and an emotional heartfelt speech to her  Instead I felt incredibly confused  TW TEAR On my final push I had a C tear as Baby decided to push her arm out like Wonder Woman  I was so close to nothing at all  The birth was not what Id expected  I wanted a waterbirth and lots of movement and instead was lying on a bed in a labour ward  But the staff were fantastic and my fiance was incredible  Hypnobirthing was an amazing help to me   My Final Thoughts  Pack the lip balm  Please pack the lip balm  I disregarded it and after being on the gas and air for a few minutes instantly regretted it   Plan for after the birth  I needed to have stitches and so fiance was left with the baby  I had it in my head what outfit she was going to wear first but hadnt communicated that so she ended up in something else  Also he facetimed our family to announce the birth without me and I would have rather he waited hes since apologised Im not mad at him just in the hindsight we should have discussed what to do prior to giving birth   Hypnobirthing can assist with any birth  Even if you want all of the drugs or a csection  You can still apply the things you learn   Everyone panics about the first poo  I ate a ton of fruit as well as the laxatives the hospital give you and was absolutely fine   Not everyone is fully qualified to check for tongue tie  Consult an IBCLC   If you dont feel that overwhelming motherly glow when you first meet your baby it doesnt mean that anything is wrong  Love grows  Thanks for reading  Sending oxytocin for your upcoming deliveries

may have been in lockdown you may have been forced to work under some form of duress you may have lost a loved one to the disease you may be left with long term side effects of the illness you may have found that regular food housing andor medical care is less attainable or more expensive nowWe could have been better off months ago but disinformation and lies have been allowed to spread readily through inaction and malice and have dragged this on at the cost of lives There are those who deny that the pandemic even exists there are those who think that wearing a mask will literally suffocate you there are those who think its no worse than a regular flu virus that its a bioweapon and everything in between This volume of blatant misinformation is problematic and dangerousIt is clear that even after promising to tackle the problem of misinformation on this sitehttpswwwredditcomrModSupportcommentsgubmisinformationandcovidwhatredditisdoing nothing of substance has been done aside from quarantining a medium sized subreddit which barely reduces traffic and does little to stop misinformationThe disinformation and false information is manifold There is no area of recognised safety procedures when it comes to battling the spread of a dangerous virus that is not under attack here All empirically proven measures which can help save lives are under attack Masks work  but not according to the propaganda The vaccine is safe it is not untested and it is not experimental technology or DNA manipulation but people getting their information from these propaganda subreddits are told the opposite Social distancing is valuable  but people are being persuaded to not even do that Cynical plays on emotion are made Trying to keep children safe is painted as child abuse Lies are repeated so frequently that misinformed people begin to believe them wholeheartedly trusting that they cant be incorrect because theyre surrounded by people who believe it alsoThere needs to be a more active involvement in preventing the spread of the disinformation that is keeping us within a pandemic that at this point is entirely manageable The main problem with a concerted disinformation campaign is that such a message attains an air of legitimacy through sheer volume of repetition This is dangerous when it comes to unsafe medical advice such as promoting the ingestion or injection of cattle dewormers a known side effect of which is sudden death  or such as trying to convince people that a tested FDA approved vaccine will cause death There is a good chance that the disinformation that reddit is currently inundated with will necessitate people a stay at the toxicology department in the hospital or even cost them their lives There can be no room for leniency when people are dying as a result of misinformation on this platform Reddit as a global platform needs to take responsibility hereWe are calling on the admins to take ownership of their website and remove dangerous medical disinformation that is endangering lives and contributing to the existence of this ongoing pandemicSubreddits which exist solely to spread medical disinformation and undermine efforts to

189,owaez2,leda22,fitpreg,6,Your power pregnancy prenatal fitness program by Ashley Nowe a review Hi everyone I hope this sort of post is allowed I read the rules and since this is a honest review by someone who subscribed to a fitness program and not a commercial advertisement I have nothing to gain from this post I hope that its ok I wanted to write a review about the pregnancy fitness program Ive been using for two months now in case it helps or is of interest to anyone out thereA little background first I am a FTM in week  During the year and a half prior to pregnancy I had built a home routine made of bodyweight exercises squats lunges inclined pushups bridges the classics min every other day Additionally I was training for a k so running a lot kweek My bodyweight routine felt easy in retrospect and I definitely was not pushing myself just trying to work other muscles than my running muscles I was getting bored with my routine so I looked for something else online I wanted a program made for pregnancy to protect my core and pelvic floor but not yoga which has always bored me and a real sports program not something too gentle for people who did not exercise prior to pregnancy both are perfectly fine if thats what youre after But I knew it was not for meI liked Ashleys Instagram and her energy so I suscribed to her program Here is what I think  weeks and  sessions laterThe program is built around  exercise sessions per week of pregnancy starting week  and going up to week  It is a monthly subscription you can start and cancel whenever you want so even if youre in your third trimester you can perfectly get on board now and start with the exercises appropriate for your current week Equipment needed  Long and short resistance bands loops of various strength light medium and heavy dumbbells I think its good that you choose the weight range for you with no set weight A small and a big exercise balls useful for core exercises a yoga matSometimes a kettlebell or a slider make their appearance in the exercises but I just adapt and do something else as I wanted to keep my equipment to a minimumWhat posed a challenge was to find in my city apartment an elevated surface bed and bathtub work best a step have to go outside and especially something to tie the long resistance band to at different heights I use doors and a special adapter since their is nothing else strong enoughNow to the program it is a little more intense than what I did by myself which is a good thing since it has become my primary source of exercise too exhausted to run Each session lasts around min sometimes a little less What I liked Every muscle group gets a good burn There is at least one dayweek for arms and chest which is good I am tired of those girls programs where you only target your abs and glutes I need steong arms thanks On the same aspect the focus is on strength and efficiency not aesthetics Since this is a PREGNANCY program it is SO refreshing Yes I want to be strong and healthy I am growing a human not competing in a beauty pageant  The core basics part of the program will appear boring when you start Do it anyway and come back to it at leat every trimester with your changing body It is full of exercises created in order for you to protect your core and your pelvic floor and to connect with both Ashley suffered from bad diastasis recti and its prevention is a key element of her program back to the main program some exercises were new to me and very efficient at targeting muscles I wasnt using properly Many of those will find their place in my everyday routine long after PP I think especially the arms and back thighs ones The use of resistance band loop was a great discovery as I had no idea how to use them really efficiently beforeWhat I dontless like the formatting Urgh This program is designed for a computer The mobile website works and is usable but the videos enter in conflict with my music player the page formatting isnt user friendly and Well Not a fan This program deserves an app the videos only shows you how to practice the move but how many reps you have to do and for how long is simply written under it Then for the next move you have to stop and click on the next video and then stop it unless you want the same sec clip played on loop over and over Again terrible conflict with music apps and no smooth workout It does get better when you arrive at exercises you already know you can smoothly go from one move to another without pausing to study the video But I like do it with me full length videos better As Ashley says this program is a template to be adapted to your needs so this format makes sense but I like being more guided throughout TLDR The workouts themselves the pelvic floor and core tips and the general idea of being strong for yourself and for pregnancy are all great and challenging for people like me who have only a limited history of working out but were fit and active before pregnancy The formatting is really annoying I think that Ill keep doing this program for all my pregnancy and I am thinking of doing her postpartum program as well I really like her energy the be strong approach most of the exercises and the fact that she is an athlete and a mother who went through a multiple pregnancy and had to learn by herself how to adapt her exercises to her postpartum body

266,ol0qb3,neepsmeeps,fitpreg,21,My Pelvic PT experience  a story of doing everything right in pregnancy and still needing help hernia DR coning I got some questions on a comment I posted a few weeks ago and promised to check back in with more details now that Ive finished some pelvic PT appointmentsTLDR you can wreck up your core with poorlycoached athletic training before pregnancy and cause issues that haunt you during pregnancy and pelvic PT can uncover some unexpected connections between different parts of your bodyIm  yrs old FTM at w along and a competitive athlete now in the old ladies division P Ive been following the Hannah Bower prenatal workout plan and her Functional Core program since day  of pregnancy I actually had an early loss the month before this pregnancy so I started a prenatal program about  weeks before conceiving this baby In other words Ive been doing pregnancysafe weightlifting cardio and breathpelvic floorcore coordination work the ENTIRE time Ive been knocked up I also was doing TVA work and deep core strengthening routines starting about  months before getting pregnant I hurt my back and decided that a comprehensive core strengthening approach would be good for the back and for pregnancy which was planned at that point By the time I got pregnant my deep core was very strong I saw a lot of improvement and was coming into pregnancy with a great foundation there So yeah I thought I was GOLDEN HA The hubrisI started seeing coning very early on  around the end of the first trimester My belly popped big and early and basically I had trouble controlling it in certain positions from pretty early on I made modifications and kept up my hard work What Im saying is I have been a HAWK about protecting my core during the entire pregnancyGuess what I got an umbilical hernia by around w and I was measured having about  finger DR at w One thing I learned while doing the Hannah Bower functional core program is that I had been destroying my core for years I have been a competitive athlete for decades and I feel like an idiot saying this but I thought I was getting muscular engagement during core work when I was actually coning as a nonpregnant person Hannah has a few videos of nonpreg athletes in her functional core program and HOLY CRAP the things she was pointing out as badconing were what I thought were a sign of good muscle engagement for years So here I am now pregnant and doing great core work for the first time in my life but really suffering consequences from previous years of poor training form  I had no idea you could have coning when you werent pregnant I thought it was just a pregnancy concern but NOPE it just looks different and more obvious when youre pregnant but is there all the timeI have been coached on lifting form in every other way but no one ever went through what proper core engagement should look like before And seeing as Hannah works with some high level athletes in these videos I think thats a common issueSo I took myself to pelvic floor PT which Hannah recommends anyway since its always great to have someone actually evaluate your progress and individual needs I have had two appointments now and here is how its goneMy PT does external exams and Im clothed for my appointments just with my shirt rolled up to show my backbelly She holds different parts of my pelvis back belly and sitz bones areas while I do pelvic floor contractions and relaxations and belly pumpsdeep core activations She also evaluated my DR Some PTs do internal exams Mine may do one at some point but so far we have been able to evaluate enough externally just fine Note that bc I have been following the core program religiously my PT and I started at like step   she confirmed that I had the foundation down well but otherwise would have started with more fundamental coaching on doing these engagements and activations and maybe would have needed to do an internal exam thenMy PT does a lot of looking at hip flare posture symmetry of my hips etc My sport tends to cause a bit of imbalance and we are working on some targeted stretching for areas that can help release that and rebalance me a bit more These issues make SI pain and SPD pain worse so we are trying to stay ahead of that bc I have felt a couple brief twinges here and thereMy back is tight as heck as are a couple small muscles connected to my hips I have a long history of tightness in a good number of major muscle groups Ive always been fighting it and she gave me a few targeted stretches to incorporate bc my normal routine isnt doable with a big belly in the way She also does some massagelike releases on specific spotsIt turns out that my back is so tight that its causing a ton of strain on my belly I never would have figured this out myself But she can manipulate my back in a way that loosens up the belly which takes some of the strain off the separating abs I now also have some home massage moves I am supposed to do to help with this too it isnt comfortable massage its actually kind of uncomfortable but I do feel better after itMy deep abdominal engagement  TVA engagement is great Honestly I was really proud to hear this I have been working on it for so many months now but with the hernia and the coning I just felt like well shit I must have been doing it wrong the whole time NOPE I have these problems because of my history of poor training prepregnancy and its exacerbated by my bad back It was a huge relief to be told that at least one thing is going well And it allows me to refocus on the back instead of just obsessing over what might not be engaging in my deep abs well enough Really I never would have figured out that my back was causing belly issues without the professional helpMy pelvic floor relaxation is really good but I have trouble getting great contractions in certain positions and somehow one side is a bit stronger than the other I had just been doing those exercises in a couple of positions and didnt really know if I was in a good place with them or not bc there isnt really much to see She has me trying some new positions to work on the engagement more holistically Again I wouldnt have thought of this on my ownI have two more appointments basically taking me thru  weeks Im not sure if we will schedule more of them thru the third trimester or just say that I have enough to work on at that point and then have me come back postnatal for an assessment of damage and developing a plan for recovery My practice automatically schedules you for  appointments when youre pregnant and I bet then its a question of assessing where you are to determine if you would benefit from more prenatalFeel free to ask any other questions Im sure Im forgetting somethingAlso yes I have this messed up core situation that I will be working myself out of for a long time but Im actually doing great in general My belly is measuring at w so its big and Im still very active I credit consistent strength training xweek Hannahs program with keeping my balance still spot on and giving me energy and strength to do a ton of physical stuff still Im renovating a house and moving and its actually OK  DR isnt a death sentence I think I was a bit overly dramatic about it and terrified of it until I got it and  nothing really changed This isnt a story only of sad news for my body p

622,mv94ss,Chuddybum,fitpreg,20,Weightlifting during early pregnancy Hi everyone I am here today for some advice and opinions on working out specifically weight training throughout pregnancySo I just recently found out that I am pregnant currently only  weeks previous to this pregnancy I have been consistently weight training Id say moderate to heavy weight training for a good  years I average non covid ofcorse  times a week for an hour so I am a healthy weight having being overweight before training Im in pretty decent physical shape now and have a good amount of strength My usual workouts consist of deadlifts squats leg press chest press Lat pull downs glute bridges  RDLs amp accessory work I work out at a level where I push myself squeezing out those last reps usually around the  rep range I am ready for my rest  my HR is spiked and breathing is heavy Upon finding out that I am pregnant I did some reading and theres a consensus that exercising during pregnancy is a great way to prepare for body changes and labour but my thoughts quickly turned to the question of is it safe to continue working out at this moderateheavy level Are there any exercises I need to avoid At what point is it no longer safe to train heavy I also worry about the affects of tensing my core amp intra abdominal pressure which is almost instinct and subconscious when doing compound movements Any advice on this would be much appreciated Ive had a look online but most blogs sites and forums relate to exercise as cardio or light weight training  Rather than women who already consistently strength train maintaining their workouts I would just like to know if I can stop worrying about it and crack on with working out until my body physically through tiredness or size tells me to ease off and that I am not in danger of harming my baby especially so early onApologies for the long and poorly written post I couldnt think how else to explain how I workout and my concerns lolThank you so much x

doomedunfitabnormal and I am here to  avoid working today bc I DONT WANNA and  share some good info to give you some context for feeling this way that blew my mind I recently did a little reading when I was feeling sorry for myself and it completely empowered me on how I feel about my current fitness so I wanted to shareMy background Im a scientist and a competitive athlete  years old first time parent nearing the end of my first trimester and had  early losses before this pregnancy Those things will factor into the anecdotal piece at the bottom so CW re the lossesAnd of course everything is a continuum It might be normal to feel some degree of this but if you feel off or something feels wrong talk to your doc But Im going to start with the science that soothed my soul httpswwwahajournalsorgdoifullCIRCULATIONAHAhttpswwwahajournalsorgdoifullCIRCULATIONAHATLDR WOW your body changes so much more than I realized and a lot of that hits VERY early on I didnt realize how quickly major changes happen in the body and I was sort of in that place of is this a real limitation or am I making excuses for myself bc its way too early to really be impacted by the pregnancy right Well I was wrong here are some key quotes that drove home to me just how big the changes are and note that there are a few sections in the article that I didnt understand so I did not excerpt here The big summary During pregnancy healthy women experience some increased shortness of breath on exertion and increased fatigue Because resting cardiac output is increased in pregnancy the maximal cardiac output induced by exercise is achieved at a lower level of work During rest or weightbearing exercise eg walking or treadmill exercise maternal oxygen uptake is significantly increased compared with the nonpregnant state Furthermore resting minute ventilation and tidal volume are increased and the expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity are decreased in pregnancy Under the influence of neurohormonal changes plasma volume increases more than red blood cell mass resulting in the physiological anemia of pregnancy and increased vasopressin secretion and drinking result in increased water retention Pregnancy is associated with vasodilation of the systemic vasculature and the maternal kidneys The systemic vasodilation of pregnancy occurs as early as at  weeks  as in you start to change EARLY This decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is  Vasodilation of the kidneys results in a  increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates by the end of the first trimester This results in decreases in serum creatinine urea and uric acid values The sharpest rise in cardiac output occurs by the beginning of the first trimester and there is a continued increase into the second trimester By  weeks the increase in cardiac output can be up to  in a normal singleton pregnancy The hearts volume and mass increases Left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular wall mass increase by  and  There is a decrease in arterial pressures including systolic blood pressure SBP diastolic blood pressure DBP mean arterial pressure and central SBP during pregnancy Arterial pressures decrease to a nadir during the second trimester dropping  mmHg below baseline but the majority of the decrease occurs early in pregnancy  to week gestational age compared with preconception values Again feeling lightheaded or weird early on Its a thing as long as it isnt too much With a big caveat the data is somewhat unclear on differences by age race and ethnicity Heart rate increases during normal gestation Unlike many of the prior parameters that reach their maximum change during the second trimester heart rate increases progressively throughout the pregnancy by  to  bpm reaching a maximum heart rate in the third trimester The overall change in heart rate represents a  to  increase over baseline Relaxin serum concentrations rise to a peak at the end of the first trimester and fall to an intermediate value throughout pregnancy Relaxin stimulates increased vasopressin secretion and drinking resulting in increased water retention Gestationdependent edema can be found in up to  of healthy pregnant women Blood volume increases significantly within the first few weeks of gestation and increases progressively throughout the pregnancy The total blood volume increase varies from  to  above prepregnancy levels usually close to  In addition to plasma volume expansion there is an increase in red blood cell production up to  via erythropoiesis Plasma volume increases proportionally more than the red blood cell mass resulting in a physiological anemia from hemodilution Bonus fun fact about physiology during delivery The maximum cardiac output associated with pregnancy occurs during labor and immediately after delivery with increases of  to  above levels seen before the onset of labor This is related to many factors including increasing heart rate and preload associated with the pain of uterine contractions increases in circulating catecholamines and the autotransfusion of  to  mL blood from the uterus into the systemic circulation immediately after each contractionSo the science says your body is working VERY HARD behind the scenes even starting by week  It is very normal to experience drops in your perceived fitness how much you lift how well you run because of this I now think of it as my body is working out internally all the time or that now its like Im training at altitude in terms of giving myself graceOn to the anecdotal pieceI got pregnant  times in quick succession so I was able to really see the impacts of switching between being pregnant and not pregnant The first two resulted in early losses but the third has been doing well With all three I experienced a very early drop off in my physical abilities I got winded very easily I got weak I lost a lot of physical output but my joint pain went away thx relaxin With both losses I bounced back really fast About a week after each loss I was back to full output and performance and sore joints This proved to me that the loss of fitness was more a loss of perceived fitness  a loss of what was visible on the outside  not an actual loss of my bodys strength and conditioningAnd for specifics on how badly my perceived fitness craters here are some stats Also I did not have to stop working out at any point so far my nausea and fatigue in the first tri have been manageable and I work a flexible schedule with no children at home so Ive been able to get good windows to keep working out consistently several times per week and eating healthy This isnt me coming back from a break this is just where I am naturallyI now lift about  of the weight I did prepregnancy depends on the exercise some muscle groups and moves can handle  some way less This is not because I wanted to dial it down but because I am not able to lift my prepreg weights with proper form anymore I feel the burn at a lot less weight than I did before conception and I can get dizzy from pushing certain things too hard Oh wellI now run about  slower for the same routes I used to run a minmile route  miles up a long hill and target the bpm HR zone It took me a good warm up before I could get up into that zone and it was hard for me to stay up high enough Now I jog that same route at  minmile because anything faster than that sends my HR up past that zone I focus on RPE and breathing and talk to myself when running but I do keep an eye on HR tooI stopped doing sprints altogether I used to do a lot of sprint intervals but now I feel like Im being jostled and anything with bounding strides makes me feel bad Its like my head is Jello I dont know if thats the increased liquid levels in me or what but noooo thanksBut my Garmin watch is telling me that my VO max has gotten a little better I didnt look into the details or think about what that actually means I just thought it was funny that I feel like Im running thru tar but somethings still workingSo in summary do your best and do what feels OK Youre doing A LOT even when you arent doing anything because your organs sure are hauling ass

867,lp2hk7,neepsmeeps,fitpreg,19,Exercise and exhaustion Edit thanks to everyone who posted stories and feedback To clarify I was concerned that maybe working out when you have super exhaustion was equivalent to not listening to your body and pushing yourself too hard or working out so hard that you cant maintain a conversation and was damagingnot recommended The exhaustion doesnt feel like my body is being worked too hard its not the same feeling as pushing too hard when working out but it is still a sign from my body asking me to curl up in bed and never leave it so I was worried about not listening to thatI posted this and then went for a jog and I feel great now Currently my pace on my trusty consistent gentle neighborhood incline is  minmile down from  minmi prepregnancy which keeps my HR in an OK place plus I did make myself talk out loud to myself every couple minutes to test  I give zero craps about how slow I have to go and some days I prefer just walking I only want to make sure I can safely do something since I know it makes me feel so much better The bonus is that I seem to get the same boost regardless of how hard I push so on days when I want to run I will and on days when I just want to walk I will be happy to stick with that instead WoohooOriginal postHas anyone seen any rules or best practices relating to exercising when youre pooped I see rules about not working out so hard that you cant carry on a conversation but what about pushing yourself to do that kind of OKsafe workout when alllllll you want to do is sleep Im finding that I need a TON of nap time and would like to do some exercise in between naps but havent seen any advice on it Basically my concern is holy crap if my body can barely stay upright when doing nothing should I be doing more than thatIm only about w and know that this is a time of hormone soup inside me I think a jog would help that but Im nervous about it when Im sooooo damn tired Thank you

951,la34yx,bikeHikeNYC,fitpreg,10,Hello from the other side  a summary of my fit pregnancy LONG This sub was an amazing resource for me while I was pregnant so I wanted to share what fitness looked like during pregnancy for me as well as some information about my recovery so far Im only two weeks postpartum but hopefully this will encourage othersTLDR I was as active as I could be and my recovery has been quick and totally smooth sailing so far My exercise of choice is hiking I also enjoy commuterurban cycling and yoga and I tend to do a lot of HIIT when exercising at home My first trimester was spent in NYC during quarantine which is a little unusual I learned I was pregnant in May after living in quarantine in a one bedroom apartment in NYC with my now husband for two months We were doing Daily Burn HIIT workouts every day  a week and taking multiple bike rides during the week to get exercise while socially distancing Most of our bike rides were  miles and I did one ride of  miles on Mothers Day Sometime around week  or  I really hit a wall in terms of nausea and discomfort in the heat and my activity tanked pretty hard I did a few more bike rides during the first trimester but nothing big I didnt go outside much for walks because our neighborhood parks were very congested and it was impossible to socially distance I kept up modified Daily Burn workouts two to three times a week and tried to do a walk of some kind at least once a week We borrowed a friends car and got out of the city to go on  mile hikes a few times That was a godsend It was a really rough time because I felt very trapped in both our apartment and in my body which really just wanted me to take naps and lie in the shower A friend told me that she felt better from the first trimester by week  which seemed SO far away when I thought Id be better by week  or  By week  I was starting to have more good days and by week  I did indeed feel better and get that second trimester energy Around the start of the second trimester in August we moved out of the city to the Hudson Valley and my routine changed drastically We had access to hikes and I had energy I started back up by doing daily walks and forcing myself out of the apartment Weeks  I was able to build back up doing Catskills  peaks hiking multiple times a week for  miles and doing a number of hikes that were over  miles I didnt ever do big hikes of ft elevation I was doing Breakneck Ridge and Bear Mountain once a week until my third trimester At six months pregnant I backpacked the Escarpment Trail with a lb pack over three days Weeks  I started to slow down but was getting one or two  mile hikes with a bit of elevation a week At week  I twisted my ankle yes while hiking and was really restricted for about a month I started hiking again at  weeks and until delivery at  I did  miles daily with ft elevation gainThroughout the second and third trimesters I kept up the Daily Burn routines but didnt do them too frequently since we exercised outside a lot In the third trimester I really enjoyed kickboxing workouts because they were low impact but still got my heart rate up I think I stopped doing those around  weeks since I could walk outside again I intended to do more prenatal yoga but I never really got into it I did some sort of stretching every day though and probably managed a yoga routine of some kind once a week throughout pregnancy I was really hoping to go into labor spontaneously especially because I was so active up until the end but unfortunately I was induced for medical reasons I had a  hour labor and got an epidural to have energy for a vaginal delivery I had a second degree tear as well as a minor tear I was out of bed roughly two hours after giving birth once the epidural wore off and moving around slowly but like normal in the recovery room I took Motrin regularly for one day then gradually stepped down and didnt need any painkillers by day three I had some soreness from my stitches but minimal discomfort overall My first week postpartum I took things very easy moving around the apartment slowly not carrying anything and using my energy for breastfeeding Week two I started to take daily walks which my OBGYN said was okay I had increased bleeding one day which my doctor thinks was just due to gravity but I took two rest days as a result out of caution Now entering week three my bleeding is very light and I think my stitches are fully healed I can easily do a  mile walk at this point and my main restriction is time as opposed to my body Im also starting kegals this week as I definitely have a very weakened pelvic floor Im not doing any exercise until Im cleared for it at  weeks but Im really hoping to walk an hour a day if my BFing baby allows it and flat hikes are also okay My big challenge in recovery is not to overdo things and I think so far Im achieving that For those of you who are pregnant youve got this I struggled with my reduced physical ability until I came to peace with the fact that my body was using its energy to grow a baby Then I just did the activity I could manage listened to my body didnt push my limits took a lot of rest days and hoped for the best
